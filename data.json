                "review_text": "BEWARE! 99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION! After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!) Pro's: 1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone. 2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8) 3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it. 4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it. 5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple. 6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here. 7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone. 8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour. 9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+. 10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds. 11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone. 12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers. 13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets. Neutral: 1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions. 2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect. 3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it. 4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it. 5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs. 6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read. Con's: 1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness. 2. \"Ok Google\". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change. 3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood). 4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button. On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know. As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot! Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways. Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.",

                "review_text": "I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network. My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website. It takes just 5-10 minutes. Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6. Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy. Other than that the actual phone is great. Very sleek looking phone. This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower. If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.",

                "review_text": "This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one. Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.",

                "review_text": "I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus. I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish. This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20. I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3T were so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8. I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me. The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands. I don't think I will go back to a 6\" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too. Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled. I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc. Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock. They should move the camera to the corner like some phones. USB-C is awesome. Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though). I have a few gripes. Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos. My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers. Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist. By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it. This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.",

                "review_text": "The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+. It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates. I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5. In the end it was worth the upgrade. As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5. I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning. Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon. This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store. This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a \"Verizon Branded\" S8. Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out. After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything. Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all. Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app. You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store. Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me. Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.",

                "review_text": "I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .) This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy: -Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though) -Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though) -Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself. -Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...) -You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!) -Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.) -It still allows your to insert microphone jacks. -USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.) -And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival. Some downsides on the phone: -Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone) -Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone. -Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled. -Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though. This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional. All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all. (Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)",

Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays. The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range. Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs. The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps. The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens. I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!",

There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures. The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).",

I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy. I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me \"Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back\". So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business? I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.",

And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card. The processor and ram have nice performance on apps. Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera. Personally, I haven't had a problem with that. Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary. The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me. I'm just not using that function. The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software. It's not bad. But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do ________? or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?' For some people, that may be Bixby. Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well. But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it. Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version. It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that. But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops. And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools. Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time. But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons. When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game. It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it. It's not a lot in the scheme of things.

Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack. With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda. Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it. Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth headsets allow the companies to track you differently. Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing. I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.

It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video.

Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly. My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case. My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.",

It may or may not have been \"unlocked by Samsung\", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone. Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types. When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying \"not a Verizon sim card\" error message in the notification tray. You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone. I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung. It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it. For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising. 1/11/2018 - Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today. It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined. Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from \"Electronic Deals\" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store.",

So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward. I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone. I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box. All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!",

(Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.) If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone. The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already. One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone. You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps. Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.

Cons: -Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case) -Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case) -Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.

                "review_text": "I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price. Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8\" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure. The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's \"Infinity Display\". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour) Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month. Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant. Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone. Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear. Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work. Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps. Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other. NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.",

Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.

The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement). The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button. I'm glad that Samsung has added a \"disable\" feature, but remapping that button would be great. Beyond that, love the phone :)",

Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&T and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location.

You can clearly see spots on the back and front glass where the inside laminate has been scraped off due to device being opened (for repair). Then there's smudge/lint/dust on the INSIDE of the rear and front camera lenses (shoddy repair job). Then most of all, there's a clicking/clacking right below the 3d touch home button area of the front screen, which again hints at a pretty shoddy repair job on whoever it was beforehand AND pretty much means the IP68 water/dust resistance is out the door. The clicking/clacking is most likely from no/bad adhesive on that screen area by whoever repaired/rebuilt the device. I wouldn't have minded a used device with some signs of use and scratches here and there, BUT the bad repair job means that A) it wasn't repaired by a certified repair place...SO VOIDED MFG WARRANTY B) the clicking/clacking area is a weakspot for the screen made worst because that's where the 3d touch home button is ALONG with it being a ingress point for condensation/water/dust Apart from all that, the battery discharge rate is pretty high even at idle. I don't feel like dealing with all these issues down the line for a phone that I want to last me at least another 2 years. I don't mind the used cosmetic state (since I use a case) of the device, BUT the BAD REPAIR JOB, along with that the device probably doesn't have any MFG warranty anymore (voided from the bad repair job), and the nonexistence of any IP68 water/dust resistance (due to bad repair job again) just wants me to stay away from this device and potential problems it could give me (if it can last 2 years). In conclusion, if I wanted a repaired/rebuilt device, I would've gone in that category instead, BUT used with cosmetic damage in my dictionary doesn't mean repaired/rebuilt. It's like thinking you're buying a used car just by going off of what the seller is advertising as a clean used car, but you're actually getting a rebuilt totaled car (which in itself could be a good thing discount wise, BUT there are definitely underlying problems)",

The battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the \"always on\" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. I haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. I'm sad to see the S Pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the Note 8, but I'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. The camera is also pretty reasonable. Low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. The camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside. The S8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. It's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately. The software is also quite nice. There's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. Samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. Overall no complaints. My carrier is Verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. I just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a SIM card for free. I was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and I called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the Verizon employee took care of the rest. I recommend using Google or Verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like Samsung Kies) to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone. I forgot to do that so I walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until I worked it out on my own. Set up backups NOW, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason I was able to get my contacts off of it was because the S Pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so I could blindly punch in my PIN to unlock the phone.",

After the transfer, about a week in, a bunch of my pictures and contacts were gone and it seems the Cloud had specifically \"chosen\" not to back those up as well. Occasionally the Maps vocal function doesn't work, I have yet to figure out why. The Fingerprint function should be located better.

Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again. The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.

Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever. Camera: Excellent Battery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day. Screen: Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like cases Size: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ish Feel: Just great and not cheap Headphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.

For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.

It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex. Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box. So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read \" not a verizon sim card\" anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. I got home and checked my main features I use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the Verizon network.",

I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with \"Hi, Bixby\". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is \"Ok, Google\". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.",

I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it. However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501.

You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, \"KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)\" & \"BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)\" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk. Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device. If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you.",

I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like \"her\" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him. Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge \"tray\" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden.

One CAUTION about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. For instance, I have AT&T, and I don't have Visual Voicemail on this phone. You should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. But other than the minor nuisance, I love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever Network I may want to use. In terms of the phone itself, I personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all.

Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app). There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app. The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out. Super annoying. Facial recognition on this phone is a joke. I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat. The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO. Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one. I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2.",

It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes. Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did). Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.",

Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable. So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc..

Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out. 2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts. Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is: -The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment. Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone. Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera. Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around. So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner. If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere. I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time). Returning this POS.",

When I received the phone, I charged it to 100%, but did NOT turn it on. I then took it to a Verizon store. After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been \"refusing to activate unlocked phones\" not purchased through them. However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8. Be persistent! Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too! Everything is working great. It is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed.",

I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted. Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this? If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!",

Stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen. Then ... Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes. I just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake! And the Bixby key? So many people don't want your Bixby key, plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. So Samsung adds the option to disable the Bixby key ... ONLY if you jump through all the hoops, creating a Samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. Nonsense. Just another data mining exercise. Then there is the Oreo update. I pay a premium for an Unlocked, from Samsung, handset ... then Verizon and T-mobile handsets get the update first. Really Samsung?? You're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major OS updates? A 200.00 Xaomi MI is a recognized Android One phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 Samsung is months late? Seriously? If that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 USD plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock Android experience. No Bixby, no 300 Samsung apps that I'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what YOU want me to do in an effort to mine my software. This will honestly be my last Samsung phone ... if I wanted a locked down experience I'd buy an iPhone. There is a very good reason why companies like Oneplus, Xaomi and Essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. A quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable. At this point, I plan to see what the Oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the Bixby button and the option to use Google Assistant like it was designed, I'll sell this junk and buy a Oneplus 6. At least then I won't be controlled by a company, being told what I can and cannot do on a device that I bought and paid for. Frankly, there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. I bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it.",

                "review_text": "I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed. The positives: 1. The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging. 2. The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers. 3. The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege. 4. The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones. The negatives: 1. No hard button on the front. I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button. I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you. It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place. That tactile feedback is missing on this phone. Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN. That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen. That's just stupid. 2. No user replaceable battery. This is simply inexcusable. I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary. There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user. It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover. Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery. I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery. 3. Oddly sized: This phone is too tall and too narrow. As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well. 4. Oddly shaped: The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets. Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image. In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges. It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped. 5. Bixby Button: Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri. There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button. Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button. But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account. Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button. Again, this is stupid. If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it. Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so. In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead.",

                "review_text": "To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the \"best phone out there\". Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is \"the best phone out there\". Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on. So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that \"During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung\u2019s sole option, without charge.\" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products. So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty. Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.",

The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious. One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it. If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it.",

I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed. Cons 1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed) 2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried. 3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen) 4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement. 5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future. Pros - (most other flagships are equal here) 1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining. 2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps. 3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices. 4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too. In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display. I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months. Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if, 1. I can get a flat display again 2. Take the buttons off the screen. 3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front.",

There are so many features on this phone that it would take me hours to explain them all in detail. They are great. From wireless charging, fast charging, the Iris scanner, and the gorgeous display. The screen has Gorilla Glass 5 and it's not easy to ruin with scratches. Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges, cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible. That was only problem I suppose that i've had so far. Otherwise, the phone is amazing and you won't be disappointed.",

I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely. Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method).

No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen. I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER.",

                "review_text": "I have had 30+ smart phones over the past 9 years from HTC, Motorola, Nexus (all except the 4), Blackberry Key One and all of the Galaxy S models plus the Note 2, 4, 5 and now the 8. My favorite phone was the Note 5, but one day I walked into T-Mobile prepared to buy the Note 7 and something steered me away from it. I ended up walking out with an S7 which was a foolish purchase because I only used it for a couple of weeks before I started missing my Note 5. Fortunately I still had it so I put my SIM back in it and all was well. When news of the Note 8 broke I was thrilled and I couldn't wait for pre-orders to start so when they did, I ordered one and it arrived one week ago today. My favorite thing over the Note 5 is the beautiful edge to edge display and how bright and legible it is in direct sunlight. At 1,200 nits, I believe it is the brightest screen ever on any smartphone even eclipsing my Blackberry Classic that I thought would never be beat. I am amazed that reviewers never mention screen brightness, but for me it is a very important top 3 feature because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and it is very annoying searching for shade or trying to cup my hand over the screen just to barely read it. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed at all with anything regarding the Note 8 screen. I have taken approximately 100 pictures and the cameras are excellent. My daughter and I just went out for Chinese food and we were taking pictures of the food and several of my Heineken bottle. She was using her IPhone 7 plus and her pictures were no match for the Note 8 when our phones were held side by side. Her photos looked washed out and dull compared to mine and she even admitted her 7 plus paled in comparison. I like to take macro shots of flowers, insects and lots of other things and all I can say is woww. One shot was of a ladybug and the closeup detail was amazing. The S Pen is more refined and I use it frequently. The single speaker is very loud and clear as is the call quality. Build quality is excellent, but I still despise glass on the back of a phone. People can go on and on about how beautiful the back is, but the same people immediately slap a case on it so its never seen anyway. Why not use some sort of a rubber or polycarbonate back and make it lighter, cheaper, grippier and definitely more durable. After all, this is a mobile device and some people actually use it outdoors and don't like cases. Probably my biggest gripe is the additional weight compared to the Note 5. At 195 grams the additional weight is definitely noticeable and like most men, I carry it in my pocket and there's never a doubt where my phone is. Samsung was smart enough to keep the headphone jack and I assume the SD card is here to stay. I have played with Bixby briefly, but don't know enough about it to comment on how useful it is. I had two ultra thin cases ready and waiting and the one I like best is the matte blue Bear Motion case. It's very thin and light and adds a ton of grip to this rediculously slippery device. It is very fluid and lightning fast and at this point I can see myself using only this phone for at least one year. K",

                "review_header": "Former iPhone user loves the Note 8",
                "review_text": "I am a long time iPhone user. I first tried the Motorola Droid before switching to the iPhone and the difference was night and day. That was back when Android phones were very slow, crash prone and unrefined. By comparison, I loved the fast and silky smooth responsiveness of iOS, the ability to share apps, the tight integration with our Macs and the idiot-proof operation. That was all before Apple tried to get cute. I\u2019d say iPhone \u201cenhancements\u201d started going south somewhere around iOS 8. Suddenly, instead of admiring how iOS always just worked, I found myself seriously questioning if Apple did enough pre-release testing and quality control checks prior to releasing new versions of iOS. It felt like we, the actual users, were the beta testers. The hardware also started getting less reliable as well, beginning with the iPhone 5. I had to have my iPhone 5\u2019s defective battery replaced under Apple\u2019s own little iPhone 5 batterygate scandal that many people seem to have forgotten about. Our entire family owns iPhones and we\u2019ve all experienced some strange issues at one point or another. These were issues like defective cameras (hardware, not software, requiring hardware replacement of the camera), cases coming apart, numerous faulty battery issues and other quirks. I had a 6-plus that would shut down and display the empty battery icon with remaining battery levels in the 20-30% range. As soon as I plugged it into AC power, the phone would power on and the battery charge status would instantly shoot up to 20%. I was tiring of Apple\u2019s deteriorating quality and angry at the fact that they weren\u2019t really innovating enough to justify yearly upgrades. The final straw was when they revealed that they now wanted to charge me a minimum of $1,000 for their newest flagship model. That greedy move pretty much drove me away from Apple. I no longer find their products worth the premium prices they charge. Now, Samsung was not perfect either. My son owned an S4 and Note 5 and both had charging port issues wihin a year. That made me very leery of Samsung. However, the switch to a USB-C charging port as well as the fact that I knew Samsung would do everything in their power to ensure this Note was perfect after the Note 7 debacle convinced me to give this phone a try. So far, I love it. The size and weight are perfect, even in a case. The phone is still easily pocketable despite its apparent substantial size. Voice quality on calls rivals my home phone. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I compared it to an iPhone X in store and I actually prefer the richer and deeper color saturation of the Note\u2019s screen. The iPhone X screen was a little brighter but also more washed out looking. I keep my Note at 50% brightness all the time and it still looks stunning. My iPhone 7 looked too dim at 50% brightness. The dimmest I could go on the iPhone and still have decent screen quality both indoors and outdoors (not in direct sunlight) was about 75%. I don\u2019t like auto-dim feature on either phone because it never sets the screen to a brightness that I prefer when indoors. The Note screen is also razor sharp thanks to a higher pixel density. I am not a fan of facial recognition on any device and don\u2019t use it on the Note, nor would I use it on an iPhone. I also do not use the iris scanner. I figured having my fingerprints recorded on both the iPhone and Note was all the biometric privacy I\u2019m willing to give up. Why put my face scan and iris scan out in the cloud as well? After hearing everything Snowden claimed, color me paranoid. I do think the Note 8\u2019s fingerprint scanner is in a very goofy location and requires awkwardly reaching around the camera while trying not to press on the camera lens to use. However, the fingerprint scanner placement and the annoying Bixby are the only cons I can really find worth complaining about with the Note 8. The speed of the Note is fantastic and I breeze through apps and tasks just as quickly and easily as I did on my iPhone, sometimes even faster. I have yet to experience any freezing or slowdown. I did deactivate the always on screen but only because I have an Android Wear companion watch, so there is no need to have an always on screen showing redundant data. As far as companion watches, I will admit that Apple does smart watches best. If that is a considerably important feature, I give the nod to Apple. My Android Wear watch isn't bad. It\u2019s just not nearly as refined as the Apple Watch. On the flipside, Android Auto is much better than Apple Car Play in my opinion, especially the ability to use either Google Navigation or Waze in your car\u2019s navigation screen, both of which blow the doors off Apple Maps, especially the latter. I get great battery life from my Note and easily get two days of use out of a charge, even with it paired to my vehicle and smartwatch all day. The S pen is a nice tool if you do a lot of hand note taking but I find it easier to just type. The Note charges very quickly and I can charge it late at night and still have it complete before going to bed. That prevents leaving it plugged in all night and risking overuse of the battery. Yes, all these phones have built in overcharge protection but being connected to AC power still wears down the battery over time. I\u2019ve had this told to me multiple times by Apple Store \u201cgeniuses\u201d as they tried to claim how all my iPhone battery issues were likely my fault due to allowing the phone to charge overnight. The excuses changed after I shared that I already knew this and therefore never charge anything overnight. The camera on the Note 8 is the best I\u2019ve ever had on a smartphone. My wife and I always envied the photos taken by her sister with her Note 5. We would all be at the same events and taking the same photos but her photos were sharper and more vivid than our iPhone pics. That was another feature that influenced my decision to switch. Another reason was the better reliability of Google\u2019s calendar over Apple\u2019s iCloud calendar. I switched to Goolge on my iPhone last year after iCloud\u2019s calendar failed to sync several very important reminders across all my devices and failed to alert me as instructed. I\u2019d create or update important events on my iPad or Mac and ithey wouldn't sync across all my devices or to my phone. It feels a little weird as an almost exclusive Apple user to own an Android phone. I myself own two MacBooks, three iPads, an Apple TV and I owned an iPhone 7 and Apple Watch before giving both away after purchasing this Note 8. However, I have fallen in love with the performance and looks of my Note 8. It feels so new and refreshing compared to the last few iterations of the iPhone (6, 6S, 7, 8) that were essentially identical phones with very slight and almost unnoticeable differences before the release of the iPhone X. However, $1,000 is a stiff price of admission to pay to finally get the first truly uniquely different iPhone in three years. I saved nearly $500 by purchasing the Note 8 rather than the 256GB IPhone X I ever so briefly considered purchasing. With stellar performance, a sleek body, outstanding screen quality, fantastic camera and the ability to handle all my smartphone needs just as well or better than The iPhone, Samsung is giving me every reason to make this switch permanent. If not for the awkward fingerprint scanner placement and unwanted annoyances like Bixby (which can be disabled by the way), it would absolutely be a perfect 5.",

                "review_text": "Update: After a couple of months with the device I am more thrilled to have switched than I was before. It's not a perfect device but it definitely deserves 5 stars for the amount of functionality you get. Here are a few things I've learned over my short time with the phone: -Battery life takes some time to \"even out\". The OS \"learns\" how you use the device over time (generally a couple of weeks) and puts installed apps that you don't use to sleep until you actually need them. In the Settings menu there is a battery saver option that you can have set to off, medium, or max. Starting out with the saver set to off it says I would get 24 hours of battery life. Now, it says 34 hours with the saver off, and 122 hours at max settings. I did an extreme test where I turned every radio on the device on turn the display to max resolution and brightness and turned the audio up to about 50%, I turned the Always on Display on. Then I proceeded to play music, and long YouTube videos, do some web surfing, and played some games. The phone lasted for 17H and 25min with 7H and 27m screen on time and it still had 13% battery power left. Enough said. -The Samsung keyboard sucks,, mainly because of the predictive text and auto correction. Just use Swiftkey, which is awesome. -The Samsung email app is nice. No real complaints there. I chose it over all other email clients for now. -The security features on this device are spectacular!. Even after formatting the phone from the bootloader it would not let me set it up as a new device without my old credentials. The Iris scanner, fingerprint ID, and Face Recognition are solid and work wonderfully. Some people want to complain about the location of the fingerprint sensor but I have long fingers and I have zero problems with it. Secure Folders is a welcomed addition to the security lineup and is useful for putting certain apps or folders under lock and key. Samsung Pay is also a great feature because it doesn't rely on NFC and doesn't use your original card numbers. I always have NFC off and I'm using an Otterbox Defender case and Samsung Pay works every time. -Bluetooth is the main battery killer believe it or not. Both my Samsung Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch and the Galaxy Note 8 suffer from this problem. Having bluetooth on drains the battery quickly compared to all other features and settings minus maybe display brightness. Starting out, this will kill battery life but over a month or so it will level out depending on your usage. Most of the time with the phone connected to my watch I will get home from work with about 78-84% battery life. Starting out it was closer to 65-73%. With it off I can leave with 85-93% easy. I'm hoping they fix some of this when Samsung finally releases Android 8.0 Oreo for the device. -You get use to the single speaker. The Note 8 only has one speaker from which you can hear music or loud speaker during a phone call. It is easily muffled and admittingly not as loud as the iPhone 8 Plus speakers. I do wish there were two speakers on the Note 8 but it is plenty loud enough with the one. -Screen protectors are hard to find if you have an Otterbox Defender case. You get lift and a drop in screen sensitivity A LOT. But there are options out there that work just fine. Just be sure to absolutely CENTER the protector on the device. The first one I got left an air pocket right down the middle of the device screen that you could only see under certain lighting conditions. The second one just sucked to be honest. The screen sensitivity just dropped to almost nothing even when there was not an air pocket and the protector had full contact with the screen minus the left and right edge. The third one is a keeper, although I do notice a slight drop in screen sensitivity it works well enough to keep the phone responsive. My point is here, that the curved screen on the Note 8 does pose a problem at least for those who use a thick rugged case, but with a few hours (or days) of mind numbing searching, a little blood, and some sweat, you can find something that works. My original review is below: I shelved my iPhone 8 Plus for this and don't regret it at all. I've been using the iPhone since the iPhone 3G and have loved the finished polish of ios and Apple devices in general. Why did I get the Galaxy Note 8? Two main reasons: 1) More bang for my buck-I spent less on the Galaxy Note 8 but got so much more in the way of features and specs. Whereas the 8 Plus was lacking so many common features found in many of the top end phones today, I feel the Note 8 has gotten me back up to date with the latest tech available for smart devices. I essentially got everything the iPhone X and 8 Plus offer in one package and for less. The build quality is excellent and I'm not restricted to just Samsung products to get the most out of my device. I have this phone in a Otterbox Defender Series case and wireless charging works fine every time. Face ID, Iris Scanning, Fingerprint ID, and Pin Codes all work without a problem (at least for me). It comes with Android 7.1.1 modified by Samsung. It's fast and fluid and because it's Android, heavily modifiable (unlike Apple anything). Yes, the phone only comes with 64GB, but yes it is possible to put up to 256GB of memory in the device and be golden. If you don't want to put 256, put 128, or 64 or however much your wallet can afford, which leads me to the second point, 2) Options! So many options! I've dealt with android before so I know most of this has to do with the operating system, but there is so much you can do with this device in the way of customizing the performance,, maintaining battery life, personalizing the interface, and increasing productivity to your hearts content. Samsung has several preinstalled apps on the device that are in fact quite useful, but if you don't want them, uninstall them and that's it. No penalty, no harm, no foul. Samsung also has a Themes app that makes it easy to download both free and paid themes for the device. The complexity of the device (and of Android in general) is not for everyone. There is a lot you can tweak and alter to get all that you would want out of the device. Of course there are plenty of presets in various categories to help the casual user streamline the customization process too, so there is no need to be shy. Overall I really enjoy this smartphone and am happy to use it as my daily driver. Battery life is acceptable ( I work a 10 hour shift in the mornings and when I come home in the evenings I'm normally somewhere between 77-83 percent battery power. This is after spending the day checking emails, maybe making a call or two, and watching Youtube videos during my breaks. Also the phone is paired with a Samsung Gear S3 smart watch (also awesome, but not perfect for my tastes). I'm using this device on Straight Talk's AT&T network and I get 84-87 Mbps download speeds while in a metal hangar at work. Whenever Samsung actually releases the next version in their Galaxy series I will be looking with great intention to upgrade if possible.",

CONS My Note 8's battery doesnt last as long as my Note 3s did even after one or two years of use. I have to recharge every 24 hours whereas my Note 3 would last a good 48 hours when I first bought it The screen ratio on the Samsung 8 is terrible. This phone is taller but narrower than the Note 3 and videos do not take up the entire screen. Instead there is just wasted black space on each side. You can pinch to zoom in and take up the whole screen but then you are cutting parts out. Taking into account the black space on the ends and the narrower phone, I'm pretty sure I'm essentially watching videos on a smaller screen now. PROS The stylus is AMAZING. This is by far the biggest upgrade for me. It doesn't even seem possible how smooth it is writing on the Note 8. It seriously feels like writing on paper with a high quality ink pen. The screen is beautiful... but with a weak battery I can't keep it on the highest settings to enjoy all the clarity it brings. Photos and videos are awesome. OVERALL I had no choice but to get a new phone. My Note 3 was falling apart. I had no choice but to stick with the Note series because I use the stylus a lot at work and there just arent any other decent choice phones with a stylus. If you don't need a stylus I would recommend checking out other phones first. If you use a stylus a lot and need a new phone, I would recommend this phone on sale.",

Pros: - Beautiful to behold - Software is smooth as butter, no lags, no stutters, no hiccups, just smooth - Software is feature packed and I'm talking useful features, not gimmicks - Nothing comes close to the S pen - Screen is beautiful in all conditions - Phone does not feel heavy at all contrary to what I heard stated by some YouTube reviewers - Speaker is adequately loud. Significantly louder than my former phone, the Note 7 (and yes I kept my Note 7) - Bixby is actually surprisingly awesome for controlling functions on the phone. It's not that great for internet related things. Good thing is you can use both Bixby and Google assistant simultaneously (Also contrary to a lot of videos I'm watched, I've not yet once accidentally pushed the Bixby button while trying to push the volume buttons) - Both front and back Cameras are great and fast. - Call quality is great Cons: - Stereo speakers would be better, I guess - Fingerprint sensor location would have been better in front, but I'm surprisingly already used to it's location and after a day I've stopped inadvertently touching the camera lens - Battery life is just okay. It will likely last all day for most people - S Note has been replaced with a much less useful Samsung Note. - Samsung keyboard is unusable. The very worst! Download SwiftKey. It's free. Update 2/6/2018: Just wanted to say after all these months I'm still very impressed with this phone. I can actually say I love it. It just works well in pretty much every way that matters and is still buttery smooth, no lag, stutter or hiccups. The battery life is great still. Samsung hit a home run with this one. Never have I ever been as impressed with a phone. I still can hardly put the phone down. If you're looking for a great phone, get this one!",

                "review_text": "Coming from an iPhone 6+, I was looking for something new and exciting in my next phone. My two options were the Pixel 2 or the Note 8. Previously used a Note 2 so it had been some time since I last used Android. I was dreading the iOS/Android conversion process but figured whatever. After setting up my phone with the apps/music/etc, it's quite fast and very snappy. Took some time getting used to the size since it's a tad skinnier/taller than an iPhone plus model but I'm sure it' won't be an issue after a couple weeks or so. Pretty much everything on the phone is very nice from the S-Pen to the display. The display is very crisp and bright and I like the fact you can change the default resolution of it. On the highest setting, apps, web pages, text, etc, all seem to pop off the screen. Very nice and something definitely worth the switch. I always get unlocked phones so I can bypass all the bloatware garbage the carriers install on these phones. With a stock Android/Samsung setup, everything works well and is very speedy. One thing I found cumbersome/irritating were all the different options/settings on this thing. Considerably more than just about any other phone I've used. Definitely takes some time getting used to. Battery life seems good. I use my phone quite heavily throughout the day and battery life hasn't been an issue yet. The S-Pen is definitely a nifty little tool for everything from doodling or whatever. I haven't really used it much but definitely a nice accessory. So far it's been a pretty solid experience with this phone so I'm hoping the battery thing from Note 7 won't be happening with this phone.",

                "review_text": "In order for me to do a complete review for this device I'd need to write a Trilogy! I will try to make this as brief as possible. First off, the display on this phone is breathtaking. Coming from a Galaxy S6 I never knew that a AMOLED display could outperform another AMOLED display. I also love that it's waterproof! I hesitated to use it in the rain since I've never had a waterproof phone before but now I don't even think about it. Next the camera was better than I imagined it would be. Zooming is incredible and I'm able to take high-speed photos without any distortion. 4K video is performs pretty much the same as my S6. It is nice that I can also plug my phone into a HDMI splitter and connect it to my TV. I haven't tried the DeX station yet but my S6 didn't support MHL so that's a nice addition. Call quality is pretty good. I love that this phone is Unlocked so it is not adhered to any one can. I have it on AT&T and believe it or not I do miss some of the functions from my S6. I would like to find out how to get their WiFi calling, Advanced Messaging, and VoLTE capability. Next, I did not think I would use the S Pen nearly as much as I do but there is so much you can do with it. Thank God I have legible handwriting or that fearure would be useless. However, my favorite thing to do is going into the PENUP app and doing some coloring. Suffice it to say the S Pen is amazing and you'll use it more than you think. Next thing that is amazing to use is the new Gear VR. It comes with a micro USB adapter so it's backwards compatible with my S6, if I really cared to use it. The last thing I'll talk about is how powerful this phone is. I thought having an Octa-Core processor and 3GB RAM in the S6 was amazing. With the Snapdragon 835 and 6GB this phone has no LAG! I'm not exaggerating either. So, if you want my opinion and you were really considering to get this phone GET IT!",

I used it with MVNO Ting.com with a GSM Sim - no issues there. 4. When I tried to update the firmware through the Settings menu I kept getting a error message that stated the phone could not be verified. This leads to step 5 5. The way to upgrade the firmware was to plug the USB into a PC, select Software Upgrade from the connection selections (last one at bottom). A new drive appears in Windows. Copy all the files to your PC to a new folder. Install the Samsung drivers and the Update Program. Run the Update program and wait for the download (+4GB) .

The system have crashed three times early on and seems stable now. This may prove to be a real deal breaker if it continues. Hoping it won't because this is simply the best phone Samsung had made in my opinion. And for either secure or enterprise purposes it is exceptional and the best available. The current S-pen outshines all the previous pens. Not many new features compared to note7's pen but it feels smoother and more responsive imo. 5 stars for a 5-star product. And if you use Samsung's before, I can tell you the bloat is well worth the phone -- both because of the hardware and, better yet, the Samsung apps quality is actually good now.",

A few of my thoughts migrating from a Note 4 (which I though was pretty fantastic). - I don't get the curved screen. Seems like a stupid gimmick to me that has little practical purpose and just makes the phone easier to break and more expensive to fix. A lot of people buying a Note are looking for the largest display they can get and still be practical to have on their person all the time. Why bend the edges of that premium display so that 5% of display real estate is now distorted? Also, how do people use these phones without a case without inadvertently activating something on the screen? Stupid. - I miss the dedicated buttons. Give me back the display real-estate used by the curved edges and then I'll give it up again to get my dedicated buttons back. I never realized how much I used the back button until I got the Note 8. Now I have to slide up the button bar (activating something I didn't want to activate about 5% of the time) and then tap the virtual back button. What a pain. And since many apps put their in-app back-button in the upper-left corner of the screen, it's even more of a pain on a large phone like the Note 8. - Battery is OK I guess. Seems to last quite a bit longer on stand-by than my Note 4 but actual use-time only seems to be a little bit better than my Note 4. That worries my a little because the Note 8's battery can't be swapped out like the Note 4. I hope it stays strong for at least a couple of years. - Bixby: I don't use it. And it's pretty annoying that Samsung saw fit to put in a dedicated button for it. At least let me program it to use as a dedicated back-button, Samsung, since you took that away. - Glass back sucks. Really. It really seems that Samsung's objective is to make the phone as fragile and hard-to-hold as possible.This is unethical. - Home screens don't rotate continuously. I suspect that this was another sacrifice of usability in order to push Bixby. Stupid. - The screen is great but I guess it should be on a $1,000 phone. - Camera seems good so far, but again, it should be.",

At least the call/hands-free audio connects via Bluetooth with no issues. My Note 3 connected/paired with my Lexus audio with no issues; the Bluetooth hands-free phone option and media worked flawlessly for years. Before purchasing my expensive Note 8 I listened to media on my Note 3 daily; now I must connect a cable to the headphone jack if I want to listen to media through the car audio! My research of the problem revealed others with the same issue; Samsung's Support resolution is \"upgrade the software/firmware in the car\"! After spending a grand on a phone, the thought of spending more money on car software/firmware updates raised my blood pressure. (It will likely not resolve the issue; it did not for others.) I'm shocked that such a basic feature does not work, especially with the flagship product of Samsung. Moreover, the feature worked with my Note 3 so I simply do not understand why Samsung somehow released a newer version of the same premium phone that is not [backwards] compatiable. I'm both frustrated and unhappy each time I drive now. I'm very tempted to return the phone but I'm hoping Samsung will release an software update that resolved the issue. If this Bluetooth media audio connection issue is not fixed in an update soon I will be even more disappointed and have to admit I made an expensive mistake by investing in this premium Samsung smartphone. I'm a big fan of Samsung phones; the Note 8 is my third Samsung Galaxy Note phone. And I have encouraged others to buy Samsung handsets. If the issue is not resolved it will likely be the last Samsung phone I purchase.",

It is a great phone except that I discovered that important features are blocked by Verizon including visual voicemail and HD Voice. Nowhere on Amazon's webpage or Samsung's webpage or Verizon's webpage do they warn you that critical features will be blocked by Verizon or other wireless carriers. Visual voicemail is a critical feature, it allows you to see a list of your voicemail and play them at your convenience, no need to dial into Verizon basic voicemail and listen to the massively annoying and slow process of hearing your voicemail read back by a robot. Verizon prevents you from installing their visual voicemail app (the free and the paid versions) on any unlocked phone. HD Voice is also disabled and there may be other features disabled that I have not discovered yet. HD Voice allows voice calls over the 4G network for clear audio and it allows you to surf the internet while on a voice call. I have spent 3 full days researching this issue and there appears to be no solution. We simply cannot get visual voicemail or HDVoice in these unlocked phones. These are free services included in your monthly bill that we cannot use, yet we must pay the bill in full. The only recourse appears to be to return the phone to Amazon or Samsung for a full refund and buy a locked version from Verizon or another carrier. Our only hope is that many customers will demand refunds and complain to Verizon and any other carrier that blocks features. I do not know of any carrier that allows visual voice mail or 3rd party apps such as Google Voice to work with these unlocked phones. So if you want convenient visual voicemail and features such as HDVoice, it is a mistake to buy an unlocked phone at this time.

You will get use to the fingerprint sensor location as you use it more often even though it is placed in an awkward location. The fingerprint sensor is fast, but it isn't the fastest I've seen. The software however, is one of the fastest Android I've used. Some people likes the clean Android version by Google; but for me, I love the way Samsung tweaked the Android OS and added many customization to enhance the user experience. The camera is super clear and can be quickly launched by double tapping the power button so that you won't miss capturing those special moments. The S-pen is super accurate, and it actually feels like I am writing on a piece of paper. The battery life is fairly decent as I can get about 4 hrs of screen on time. Overall, if you want a speedy, large screen, good camera, S-pen stylus, and a premium looking design, I would recommend this phone if price isn't an issue.",

I did not like the taller screen, it reformats youtube videos to a smaller size and leaves an inch of nonused screen on each side (something I feared since the shape changed to so longer). My note 4 is a perfectly filled screen for internet, youtube and my own camera videos. Even with amaxons amazing black friday discount, i decided to return it. I can buy replacement batteries for this old phone from walmartt for less than twenty bucks. I'm good with the note 4 for now, thanks though samsung. :)",

Screen is awesome, form factor better than note 5, fits in hand better. Face recognition works great - sometimes too well - but is dependent on lighting conditions. Fingerprint sensor is in an awkward spot, but with face recognition, i don't have to use it much. If battery life continues to hold up, would give 5 stars.",

There's a great number of features that I don't even use, but I'm sure are great. Some reviewers on here complain about the battery not lasting a week on one charge. I don't really understand this sentiment. I not only haven't had an issue with the battery draining quickly, but even if this is an issue for some users, I have to assume they're using battery intensive features a great deal. Also, I personally don't find that charging my phone is an inconvenience, especially with how fast it charges, and considering Samsung's massive debacle with the Note 7's battery, you can understand why they wouldn't gamble on creating a super-battery. Anyway, this is a really great phone. The negative reviews are nonsense. And like I said, the only downside (for me) was the price tag.

The Note8 is marginally bigger, has dual cameras, slightly weaker battery, 50% more RAM, and the S Pen (which is far more useful than I had imagined). I've had so much fun changing the way that I take down notes on my phone and editing things. I'm still learning new features with it. You'd have to try it to really see what I mean. Trust me, though; it's worth it. I'm not really an artsy or techy type person, and I still find it really useful. In the hands of someone creative, the Note 8 would be even better!",

I've still got tons to learn about all the new features, and although I clearly did not NEED a phone at all, this phone did give me the one thing I have been missing since my first smartphone in 2012 -- the sheer joy and exhilaration I get from having and using this phone! It's an experience I've never had with another phone (the Note 4 came very close, but I had to cease using it, since it was carrier locked to Sprint, the most overpriced carrier and worst customer service in the world, even to long time customers since 1997 [to December 2015]). Die Sprint (for the God-awful price plans, customer service, and the zero love and respect to your most loyal customers)! So I treated myself to a ~$1,000 phone I did NOT need, and it has felt like the best ~$1,000 I've ever spent! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants an out-of-this-world phone that feels like advanced alien technology! So if you have an extra $950+ bucks to blow, and/or have a phone you don't like or enjoy, and want a phone that will blow your mind, that you will enjoy no end, then do yourself a favor and get the Samsung Galaxy Note 8! I can't imagine anything changing this experience, barring them blowing up like the Note 7 fiasco. To date, this is hands down the best, most amazing phone on the planet. Don't believe me, go check MKBHD's videos, and the rest of the gurus online. :) - One happy af customer!",

If you have a big hand, it is OK but I don't suggest it for people have small hand like me. It is fast and beautiful but if you put it on the protection case, it become ugly and very big size. But if you don't buy the protection case, the phone will be broken if it drop on the floor (some people review their Samsung was broken the screen and the manufacture don't want to replace the new one to them so I put it on a protection case to protect the phone is broken when it is drop. Next time, if I bought a phone, I will buy small size not big size like that because I can not put it on my purse like iphone, and because it is big so my hand is so tired when use it. I hope in the future Samsung manufacture make the phone smaller and use the Corning Glass V for screen to avoid the phone broken easily.",

I had a 12mp camera and the quality was good, then I got a Samsung S4 ZOom with 16 mp and 10 x zoom. i was afraid there won't be a cam phone to replace my s4 zoom, now that I have had my s4 zoom for about 5 years. I waited for Black friday, but on Thanksgiving day I could not wait any longer I bought it in a Heartbeat. I am so in love with my phone. It is so sleek and fragile, but i do my best to protect it. the dual cameras almost are like my 16mp phone, only better. speed of the photos are just amazing. i love the s pen feature, i can colour and take notes, etc. This is just the best phone ever made so far by any phone manufacturer. its fast and bright . I use the zizo case, but it feels like a big weight hugging my neck, so i clip it to my pocket and you can turn it inside or you can expose the screen, I have a skinomi screen protector on it and it protects very well.",

                "review_text": "I bought this phone on Thanksgiving from Amazon on sale for $170 off MSRP. I was on the fence about spending so much money for a phone, but I am glad I made the leap after 5 days of use so far. I am using this phone on Cricket Wireless (AT&T). My previous phone was a Motorola Z Play GSM edition. I loved that phone's battery life, the JBL speaker mod, and the Hasselblad Camera Mod. it truly is the best mid-range phone on the market today (better than Z2 Play)... with one downfall... The camera on the Z Play was mediocre at best. With a 15 month old baby at home to take pics of for family... Forget getting quick, clear snaps. The camera lacked quick focus or quick picture taking and also didnt have OIS or EIS. In other words, the camera is very very disappointing... for anyone considering buying that phone. I wanted to upgrade, so I researched mid range phones like the Z2 Play, the OnePlus 5T, Huawei Mate 9 and other phones for replacing my Z Play. For $5-600.00, I could buy an S8 unlocked that is waterproof and has a better camera than most of the midrange phones on the market. Previously, I owned the Note 2 and Note 4 (Sprint), so I decided to go all in and buy the new Note 8... But this time, factory unlocked so I can use any carrier in the US. Here is my experience with the phone so far: Pros: \u2022 Blazing fast Snapdragon 835 (6GB of Ram is perfect with this processor) \u2022 Touchwiz has no lag... Unlike the other Notes I've owned \u2022 The camera and camera features on this phone are great. Camera is laser fast with taking clear photos/videos, which was what I needed with a toddler running around the house \u2022 Display is brilliant and has a Blue Filter to reduce glare and eyestrain \u2022 Flashlight brightness can be adjusted \u2022 Micro SD card slot is always a plus \u2022 Great signal strength, even with Military Grade Samsung Kickstand Case installed. \u2022 Waterproof down to 5 ft for up to 30 minutes. Cons: \u2022Battery life is subpar compared to Moto Z Play, even with the Note 8's \"Mid\" Battery Saver option enabled. I'll have to further \"de-bloat\" this phone. \u2022Downfiring speaker at bottom of this phone is terrible when compared to Moto Z Play with JBL Speakermod \u2022 Finger Print Sensor is in a bad location \u2022 Non-Removable Battery (always a minus, but all phones have non-removable batteries now) \u2022 If you have small hands or have pants with small pockets, get a regular Galaxy S8 instead. This phone is massive in size. \u2022 It's pricey... But if you own a business or have kids, its worth the extra money to have the best features. Overall, I can deal with the battery life issue and a bad sounding speaker in order to have a flagship phone that can take good Pictures/Videos. I am happy with my purchase and hope to see more of whats changed since I had my Note 4.",

If we find something else that will work back they go. First although Samsung claims they are compatible with carriers I found they have a couple incompatibilities. May find more as I experiment over the next few days. First, the Always Forward Calls function does not work. I spent time with ATT to be sure it was the phones and not ATT. They proved it was the phone. She said that is common with Samsung Unlocked phones. I contacted Samsung. First Rep told me their internal resources showed this was a known problem. But, there would be an update to fix that. The second Rep said the problem with Call Forwarding had never been reported. I was the first. But, probably this was just the phone. Two Reps, Two different stories. In any event the function doesn't work. What else I'll find as I learn more about the device who knows? The Fingerprint Reader only Unlocks the phone. It will not lock it. The Fingerprint Reader on my other phones both lock and unlock. Alerts and Notifications are different than my previous Samsung phones. Looked for a concise explanation. No joy. Customer Service could not point me to anything than their online tutor that they said required me and the Rep to be online together. Over time I'm sure I'd get up the learning curve. Frankly, they have lost my trust. Private Specifications that affect device performance and usefulness not disclosed to the customer is bad ju-ju. On sthe good side: the phone shape is really good. Making the rectangle longer on one dimensiion makes it very usagle with one hand. The person who wanted the stylus so far is fully satisfied. The display is very good. Too soon for battery life evaluation. But, on first two charges we got over 14hours with mixed, but mostly internet use. Not great, but acceptable. Voice quality in phone calls(yes we still talk on the device) is very good. Haven't gotten to the other critical functions yet. So, attitude may go up or down.",

It technically partially works; LTE, CDMA, 802.11AC all fine, just no firmware support for advanced calling features (though oddly, VoLTE did function). The phablet itself is well made, and the display looks good when looking directly at it. The display otherwise has a terrible blue-shift when looking at even 10\u00ba off angle in any axis. I was very surprised to discover this after reading so many positive, professional review sites exclaiming the virtues of the Super AMOLED display. It's also a little stuttery, as if the GPU can't draw over 60FPS when scrolling in Chrome. Those downsides mentioned, the display looks incredible under the right circumstances being perpendicular to your view plane, and not skewed off axis laterally at all. The camera is also stupid nice. I didn't have time to enjoy the S-Pen due to hours wasted today in trying to get basic, 4YO calling functionality working on this $1k device. That mentioned, I think that I will try buying it directly through Verizon since I'm sick of iOS. Cheers, and I hope that Amazon CS updates the advertising on this page to reflect this glaring omission of an otherwise good product. Experience: -1 stars (negative stars...)

There are folks who don't like the Bixby key, but the key, and Bixby, are really useful once you set them up. You can also disable the key if it bothers you too much. The button and Bixby also pair well with Google's Assistant, picking up slack where Google's Assistant faces limitations. All in all, you get what you pay for and this is a beautiful phone with endless possibilities of uses.",

Here are my observations so far: \u2022 Even when buying new batteries for my Note 4, the battery life just was getting suckier and suckier. The Note 8 easily lasts all day with regular use. Let\u2019s hope it stays that way because you can\u2019t remove the Note 8\u2019s batteries. \u2022 Love that they still included an SD card slot in this phone. \u2022 S-pen is better than ever, pressure sensitive, and can use it in a lot more places\u2026. But how often do I use it? Seldom to never. \u2022 The C-type USB makes the Note 8 charge super fast. \u2022 The drawback is that it does not charge really fast when plugged into regular USB-2 ports, I get a warning on my phone telling me to plug in to a different spot. \u2022 The screen size is big and beautiful, essentially going edge to edge. This phone does not add a lot of width over and above the older Note series, but is much taller. \u2022 Sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I would like \u2022 Bixby is a slow learner. Either you are going to need to invest some time with this to get it to work right or you will be annoyed that it wastes a whole button just for its operation. \u2022 Love the apps edge menus. Very customizable and actually useful. \u2022 The face recognition works great for me, but not so great for my hubby who wears glasses sometimes. \u2022 The back shows finger prints terribly. If you have a case, this won\u2019t be an issue. \u2022 The launcher that comes on the phone is definitely an upgrade from what the Note 4 had, much more functionality and customizing options. \u2022 Overall great phone. Got any questions? Ask me in the comments section and I will try to help you out.",

Not only does this phone have a beautiful design, it also has a powerful processor and loads of convenient features for everyday use. My only gripe about this phone (aside from its price tag) is the location of the fingerprint sensor which I personally don't really need to use it since you can also use a pin, password, pattern, face recognition or the iris scanner. You have options! As for the battery; you DO NOT have to charge it twice a day like another reviewer mentioned in one of the reviews. I charge my Note 8 in the morning if it needs it. It takes less than 1 1/2 hours to fully charge thanks to the quick charge technology. Once the phone is fully charged, I open power saving mode from the notifications panel and I select MID power saving mode to prolong the battery life and, just in case you're wondering NO it does not affect the phones performance at all. This phone is equipped with 6 GB of RAM so you have the ability to run multiple apps at once with or without the power saving mode feature turned on. This phone is a beast at multitasking and obviously like any other phone it will use up battery life when using all of its resources for a long period of time. For those of you who are really curious about this phone, check out YouTube videos by SuperSaf TV, Android Authority, Sakitech and many others who have posted detailed reviews about this phone. The dual camera with dual OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) takes amazing photos in low light and has so many cool filters and, also comes with its own photo editor pro. You can crop someone out of a photo and place them in another (that's if you're into that kind of stuff). It's the best camera on the Android and possibly even Apple market. At first I was a little annoyed with the Bixby key (Not Bixby) just the key. You can now disable the key which opens Bixby home. Bixby home is just a portal that shows you what's trending on your YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter feed and, also shows you the current weather forecast' which you can conveniently choose to pin or hide from your Bixby portal. It's not as bad as people say it is. Bixby however' is pretty cool. Bixby is not just an average virtual assistant. Bixby does a ton of things like takes screenshots, creates new contacts, opens any specific Pandora station, opens Google maps and navigates to any address you ask for, gets you an Uber and many other things. One of my favorite Bixby features is the ability to create Bixby commands. For example' you can command Bixby to turn on the blue light filter, do not disturb mode and, always on display just by saying \"goodnight\"! In the morning I have her programmed to turned those features off just by me saying good morning. I could go on and on about this phone but, I recommend for anyone interested in this phone to watch YouTube reviews (like I did) before purchasing. Happy Shopping!",

The off-screen clock view does not appear to use much noticeable power. The fact that the phone \"wakes\" up into the off-screen clock where the fingerprint sensor is active (and can unlock the phone) means it feels quicker to unlock than my old Galaxy Note 5. Iris detector also works surprisingly well. I registered my irises with glasses off but it gets it with glasses on usually after a second or 2 max of adjusting the phone's distance. Only complaint is a minor detail about the keyboard - long-pressing on a key helps you quickly insert punctuational characters, and it works similarly to my old Note 5 with one exception, the long-press time is notably longer on the Note 8 such that it's extremely annoying to use. Wish there was a tunable somewhere to adjust that. The Note 5 had it perfect.",

Bixby learns fast, and is both fun and functional. Along with all the other connectivity options, it adds MST. That gives it the unusual (unique?) capability to use Samsung Pay not just where the vendor is set up for it, but anywhere there's a card swiper. Very cool! I hear complaints about the location of the fingerprint sensor,but I have no trouble locating it (it's easy to feel at the left edge of the \"window\" where it lives with the dual cameras).I don't use it for unlocking, but it also serves to drop down the notifications, making that a one-handed operation. It's a large phone, but less wide than many smaller phones. I have very small hands (no wisecracks, thank you very much), and have no problem holding it or using it. Just a great device. And it's expensive, but so is every other good phone, so for a couple of extra dollars a month, I have everything I want. Oh, and it's very good as a phone, too!",

Overall, the best Android phone for those who want a big screen and think the pen is handy, like me. Cons: So big and smooth it's hard to hold without risk of it slipping out of your hand without a silicone or rubber case even with large hands, but with the curved edge-to-edge screen even a Note8 designed case makes hitting the edge controls and last column of keyboard characters a challenge with human adult sized fingers. Prices for halo phones are getting into the \"maybe upgrading every 2 years isn't necessary\" range. Stupid fingerprint reader placement, right next to the phone lens which you want to never touch with your fingers to avoid smudges. The eject pinhole and the microphone pinhole are exactly the same size, and the official instruction website just shows a wireframe black rectangle and says stick the pin into the corresponding hole, so it's unclear which one you need to jam the needle tip into to pop the SIM card drawer open to install a microSD card - probably bad things would happen if you pushed it in the wrong hole too far.

                "review_text": "I loved my old Samsung Note 4 until the screen broke and would have cost more to fix than the phone was worth. The Note 8 is definitely a huge improvement on many fronts -- a more vivid screen, a zippier processor, more than ample memory, above-average battery life, wireless charging, and superb security features. The Note 8 can be unlocked by fingerprint sensor, iris detection, face detection, voice recognition, passcode or pattern, authorized GPS location(s), and detection of registered Bluetooth devices nearby; these security measures are used concurrently, so there is rarely any hesitation in unlocking the phone. So why only three stars? First, I hate the curved \"infinity\" screen -- it's not well-protected by any case I have found and it scratches far too easily. Second, the S-Pen stylus is far too sensitive, making it extremely difficult to write legibly or make accurate drawings, for example; unfortunately, the stylus sensitivity is NOT adjustable, which is a huge miss, in my opinion. Hell, the stylus is the reason most users buy the Note 8 instead of the Galaxy S8, so to not offer a customizable experience is absolutely baffling! Lastly, Bluetooth performance is pretty weak for a flagship phone like this. I regularly have connection problems on a multitude of devices, can't stray more than a dozen feet away, and suffer annoying drop-outs on wireless earbuds -- all problems that my wife doesn't have with her much older iPhone. Come on, Samsung, get your sh*t together! For 900 bucks I expect a lot more than a phone that won't burn up in my pocket.",

Although phones continue to get more expensive, Samsung manages to have great sales on their phones. I personally got my phone on a Black Friday special for just $600. I could not be more happy with this phone. Let me address the common issues with this phone for starters. This is one of the largest phones on the market and if you have small hands or even just slightly under average size hands this phone most likely will not be for you. If you have average size hands, like me, you can get away with putting a pop socket on the back to handle the phone. Battery life on the phone was slightly sacrificed by putting the S-Pen in, but the battery is fairly large and there is also battery saver mode. It is also made out of all glass and can be very slippery without a case. Some of my personal favorite things about the phone, even after using it for the last 2 months, the S-Pen. Many reviews say that you will get over it after using it a few times but as a finance major, I am fascinated by the stock market and cryptocurrency. I HATE having streaks all over my screen so the S-Pen just seems like the best action to take to prevent them. Also, coming from an iPhone, I was not a fan of the screen size but it quickly grew on me and I have found it to be one of the nicest features on the Note 8. I am also a fan of the always-on display, I can have my phone sitting on my desk and not have to touch it to see if I have received any notification and it only drains the battery about 1-2% per day. Overall one of the best phones I have ever used and I can happily say that I have been converted.",

I was planning on getting a Note 7 last year, but started to see the \"fire\" stories just before I went to purchase, and waited another year. I was a little disappointed the body was slimmed down compared to my Note four (I liked the wider real estate for videos), but have quickly gotten over it. I'm still learning the new features, and especially like a few such as being able to swipe up for apps vs hitting app key, always on display and the many places to hide groups of your favorite apps. On a day one appraisal, it seems to be quite quick and fluid. Wireless charging works like a charm, even through a case, and wireless charging pads do not cost an arm and a leg...authorized dealers sell them for as little as $20, and you can find them on that auction site for as little as $7. Camera takes awesome photos and HD video, although I have not tried the dual lens feature yet. Getting rid of the physical home button was long over due. I did not purchase my phone here, I purchased it at that big box electronics store, and unlocked was actually $20 cheaper than the AT&T (my carrier) model. Something you need to know if getting an unlocked one...the sim from your old phone may or may not fit (mine did not), but if you have the older, larger sim, just take it to your carrier and they will \"punch\" the chip out of it free, so it will fit the Note 8, and save you the $$ of buying a new sim. Now for the cons: 1) PRICE. Tax included this phone will set you back $1,000. This is the future of new premium phones, and that future is EXPENSIVE. 2) Non-removable battery. This phone is not noticeably thinner than my Note 4...so they can't blame \"saving space\" as a reason not to return to removable batteries as people have been begging for ever since they took them away with the Note 5. They are just following Apples lead by building in an expiration date (when your battery dies). I HATE this new trend, but pretty much all premium phones now have non-removable batteries, so what are you gonna do? 3) 128GB? What 128GB model? Stories have been put out that the Note 8 would be available in 64GB and 128GB models...AT&T does not have them, the big box store where I bought mine did not have them...do they even exist? Update 12/01/17: This is my first \"unlocked\" phone. I have used AT&T models before this. After buying, there was a SYSTEM update available immediately, but I don't have to mess with the monthly AT&T \"security\" updates... I call BS on security updates, it seemed that after every monthly update from AT&T, I got more, and more and more spam...the updates seemed to be nothing more than open invites to my phones bandwidth.

                "review_text": "ceptional phone! New features galore and all an improvement to every Galaxy Note I've owned (which has been all of them). If you're concerned about having to learn a new phone and a new way to do everything you're already used to doing on your old phone, No Worries. Besides a bit more of Samsung integration (mostly helpful if you don't count Bixby yet). Like better & easier backup/restore options, more freedom with settings and customization if you want to utilize them, an easy top notch optimization tool and ways to integrate old apps in a way that will utilize everything this phone can offer. Everything that was new and complicated in learning a new phone is intuitive, cleaner looking and better organized. The manner everything is presented leads to an enjoyable experience of discovery in to what this phone is capable of. Rather than the frustrating research into countless forums and how-to materials to find out what's new, how it works and how to make it do what you need To put it simply, this phone is intuitive in presentation without sacrificing depth of implementation. Only problems I've had are: - Glass Back, Within the first 2 weeks of having the phone my cat knocked it off My 2' high coffee table onto a ceramic bowl/planter. It immediately cracked the glass and spider webbed across the back of the phone. - Second, Bixby... it doesn't feel like an all-in-one go to assistant utility. It feels kinda scattered a bit like a few little, though creative and cool, Bixby \"apps\" that can do specific things by themselves but work together with an otherwise pretty basic Bixby assistant. Fortunately it's easy to turn off and Samsung makes sure to present options to use another assistant if you'd like. - Lastly, The screen, It's big it's beautiful it's amazing but there are a few apps I found that don't wanna work with it because the developers haven't updated them to fit within the screen size. ( Like trying to watch widescreen movies on an old standard TV back in the day) And not necessarily a complaint but just an observation..... the speaker is arguably par of not sub par... in clarity and volume. It's not auditory garbage but just a bit above basic and unusable. Otherwise... easily my favorite device I own right now. I wanna buy it a dress and marry it.

Switched to google assistant, much better. Bixy is the one star loss on this review. Screen protectors seem very incompatible with the curved screen. Cant find one that works well. Cost Slippery, must have a case on it to avoid activating everything when inadvertantly touching the sides. Much easier to use with a case. Pros Dual camera. Great camera. The reason I ponied up for the overpriced note 8. Optical zoom nice, bokeh effect very nice. Best in class screen, love the large veiwing area. Software, other the afore mentioned, Samsung got everything right. Elegant and smart interface. Sim card slot, better waterproof rating than iphone x. USBc ports, no more struggling to see which side is the up or down on the port. Has an audio jack unlike iphones. Its a fun phone and has a smart stylus.",

                "review_text": "Samsung Note 8 is an excellent bit and it surely has some of the finest specs of this generations High End phones, but it is expensive. Question is, If you should buy it in the April 2018 or not? To begin with the Samsung Note 8 has a snapdragon 835, 64gb of storage that\u2019s expandable, 6gb of RAM which is 2GB more than the S8+, The phone and stylus are both independently IP68 water resistant. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, Thank you Samsung for always keeping it there, a USB type C, dedicated button for bixby, it comes in grey gold blue black and I have the Black as you can see. A beautiful super amoled screen with 521 ppi of pixel density & 83.2% screen to body ratio. So its definitely a bigger brighter visual experience, pretty cinematic I must say. So what are some of the really cool things we can do with the Spen which is indeed what makes this device a Samsung Note. If you come with the aesthetics of an artist or going to become the next paablo picasow or Leonardo Daaal daaa vinsee i then the Spen is definitely a precision device. As you can see in the video review it can really get down to deep tight spots whilst drawing. But someone with my drawing skills won\u2019t get much of it to be honest. Also SPen is capable to take notes during a call. In case you need to jot down a name or phone number quickly. This can be done on screen or separately in a note memo as well. You can also translate at the tip of Spen, it\u2019s pretty quick and useful. One fun thing we could do with SPen is the live message, so draw down your short message and yes it can be sent via all your favorite sharing apps as long as they support GIF\u2019s. It does send the message along with the animation which makes it super cool. Spen has added a bit more to multitasking buy introducing app pairing, so now you can pair two apps you wish to use side by side and can launch it with a single tap conveniently. So apart from the SPen, Samsung has introduced their very first Dual camera in Note 8. It\u2019s a 12mp telephoto and 12mp wideangle lens which will give you that depth of field and the ability to control how much of the background should you wish to blur and make that focused object stand out. Both the cameras have optical stabilization, and better low light results. But the nicest bit for me was the 240 fps slow motion. Although it doesn\u2019t capture the video at 1080p but 720p is fairly decent Now We know the specs, the new features of SPen & the all new Dual lens cameras of the Note 8 but should you buy it or not? Fact is the note 8 has pretty much the same DNA as the S8+, same processor, a screen which has almost the same brightness, its just 0.1 inch bigger than the Samsung S8+. Same Malig71 mp20 graphics. The camera yes its Dual lens, but does it make a difference to me, not really. I am not very particular about the depth of backgrounds in my pictures. Besides that it\u2019s as good as the pictures I get from my S8+. Have to mention when you buy a better bigger phone, you expect the battery to be better as well, this however isn\u2019t the case with the note 8, a 3300mah battery compare to the 3500mah battery of the S8+ resulting in less talk time eventually. If you are the loyal Spen user then it\u2019s a must have for you but the ugly truth is that the Samsung note 8 costs a whopping 930$. Which is 241$ more than the S8+ & 90$ more than the s9+. With the launch of S9+ the prices of S8+ will eventually dive down. So there we have some facts aligned to make us decide if we should be buying the galaxy note 8 in April 2018 or should we give it another thought.

Battery life: I was a bit skeptical in the beginning because of the smaller battery size but somehow Samsung managed to make it last longer than phones with bigger batteries. One reason for this is the sensible software management that lets you snooze/hibernate apps that you don't use often. Smart move. Build quality: This one cannot possibly be challenged. A bit too tall and a bad position of the fingerprint scanner are the only complaint I have. I love everything else about this phone. Call quality and coverage: Absolutely great on T-Mo's network. In fact I am to use this phone at places where their coverage is usually terrible. Software: Very fast phone. Touch Wiz has greatly improved. Its very fast and fluid on the Not 8 even if you open a million apps or tabs. Camera: I'm not a camera enthusiast but I believe its among the best. S Pen: I know many people don't see the use it but it is indeed a wonder tool. It has made my life much easier. Samsung has delivered this time again.",

                "review_text": "This is the latest generation Galaxy Note device from Samsung released this month and I think its one of the best devices produced by Samsung so far. I am personally a big Note series fan as i have used all the note devices before and this one by far is the best in comparison. like any other Samsung smartphone this device is also loaded with features useful for all types of people like students, business personnel and even for those at home at everyday use. this new device is also equipped with new dual lens 12MP camera which enhanced the photography experience to the next level. this camera has latest features like dark imaging enhancer, dual background imaging which takes up to 23% more image than you need with extended wide angle imaging. all these features are more than beyond attracted to people who are involved in photography as this gadget is the perfect fit for them as this phone is more portable than a professional DSLR camera. moreover Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has a new end to end display which is the most sharp display with super amolded screen 4. This new screen has sharpest resolution Samsung has made with spectrum producing millions shades of colors. I think this is the best infinity display in the market compared to its competitors. This new Note phone as also received a very impressive IP68 rating for dust resistance and water resistance. this is the highest rating given to the phone for water resistance in the market as this phone can withstand under water of depth of 1.5 meters for 30 mins. its an impressive figure for people using this phone outdoors in conditions like rainfall. like always Samsung Note phones comes with a stylus S pen which from years have improved. this time around samsung has released the S pen with new over haul design and more than ever sensitive response. there are endless activities a person can perform with the new stylus making the phone more practical than ever. the stylus allows you to do multitasking at very efficient ways like taking notes in class or recording the data for an assignment outdoors without need of a laptop. it also connects to your social media and allows you to write and draw many types of emoji and facial expressions making communication more realistic than before. there is also a new feature this time around which allows you to write on screen with your phone locked to make quick notes. All these high tech innovative features and specifications like powerful snapdragon 835 processor with 6 GB RAM and options for micro SD card installation comes with a hefty price of $950 which is a lot to ask for. This device may also lack in repairing department as filled with so much technology, it may be impossible to get it repair if something wrong happens to it. Overall in my opinion I think this device is the new leap forward in the smartphone technology and is something to look forward to with very minor downfalls and multiple uses, this device is one to get for everyone.",

The note 8 quite literally can do just about anything and everything you could imagine a smart phone being able to do. Its fast and very responsive, the battery isn't bad, the screen is absolutely beautiful. The camera is the best I've ever seen on a phone. There is just so many good things to say about it. The S pen is a nice little bonus and does what its suppose to do. Speaker and sound quality is good. Bluetooth and WiFi signal is above average. The settings and options in this phone seem bottomless and I could spend weeks learning everything this thing is capable of. I have very few complaints and issues, only minor ones that don't outweigh the good. There's just a few poor design choices. For one, although the all glass body is very nice, sleek looking and feels good in your hand, having a phone this expensive and be this fragile is not a very smart design choice. The curved screen is beautiful but makes it very difficult to protect in a case, which you are definitely going to need one. The buttons on the sides are very awkwardly placed, with the power button almost in the center and directly opposite of the volume and Bixby button. The bixby button should not exist in my opinion or be remapable. Its to close to the volume button and always gets pressed by mistake. Again, these awkwardly placed buttons also make it difficult to fully protect the phone using a case. All in all, this is the best phone out on the market right now with hands down the best screen. in my opinion anyone should be happy to own one.",

Waterproof for 30 minutes submerged. The S Pen is better than ever. I forgot how addicted I became to the S Pen after using it for years on the three previous Notes I had. I keep dropping this thing during the first 9 days I have had it and the gorilla glass of course is so hard to damage. The battery lasts longer than the iPhone X. Charging from 0% to 100% in 98 minutes...which is almost exactly the same as every Note I have ever owned (anywhere from 90 to 100 min for them). Fantastic. I am so happy with this phone, especially for a phone $70 cheaper than iPhone X that is made by free adult workers in a democratic country instead of by forced and abused laborers in China. This Note 8 was totally worth the wait. So sleek and beautiful. And the ear buds that come with it are almost as good as the $150 pair I already had. I love this phone!",

The Note8 lacks both. Even the pen, while great, the app to use it the most (their own Notes app) is terrible compared to the one from the Note3. Gear VR: they had to come out with two headsets in 2017 because the s8 headset which I have doesn't fit the Note8.. This shows a clear lack of planning on Samsung's part, and troubling as this is beginning to feel like a trend. To be clear I like the phone and don't regret buying it...

One major issue with this phone is the price, there is a lot of good phones out there for half of the price of the note 8 so for someone in a tight budget this may not be a good option, however considering the amount of things this phone can do, and what the competition has to offer, i have to say the price is worth it, this phone is like a Swiss Army knife, let me explain... The S pen. 3.5 mm headphone jack. Really good headphones in the box. Micro sd card support. Fingerprint scanner. Iris scanner. Face recognition. heart rate monitor sensor. Fast Wireless charging.

The phone is absolutely amazing! However, when the SD card, which Samsung conveniently delayed the shipping by 3 weeks from when the phone arrived, is inserted into the phone (everything was ordered at the same time)... it only worked for about 2 days prior to giving an SD Card error. I assumed it was a faulty SD card so used a different one I had from a previous phone, the Samsung S7... Unfortunately, the same error even with the different SD card. So, I call Samsung technical support... they agreed, after having me run through several tests, that the error was with the Note 8 SD card reader. Here is the crazy part! They refuse to replace (or take back) the phone stating it was over 2 weeks post delivery. How convenient! They delayed the arrival of the SD card by 3 weeks so that when the error occurs at week 3 they no longer need to take responsibility for the fault in the phone. In all fairness, they are offering to fix the phone but I shouldn't have to fix a brand new phone and try to figure out what I am going to use as my phone for the several weeks it will take for them to repair it. They should do the right thing and send me a new one! Anyway, rant over. I would highly suggest that you check the SD function immediately after getting the phone. Mine worked for about 2 days then began giving errors. However, it would be work again once rebooted.... weird. I tried to reinsert the card numerous times and the restart of phone got old really fast. Otherwise, the phone is fantastic!

You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, \"KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)\" & \"BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)\" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk. Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device. If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you.",

I picked up a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 from Best Buy on November 1 and I will never look back. I have had iPhones since 2010 (iPhone 4 32gb; iPhone 5 32gb; and most recently an iPhone 6s Plus 64gb) and have a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" that I use as a daily computer for personal, work and school purposes. The Note 8 blows every iPhone out of the water and after having seen what Apple unveiled to us this last Keynote, the iPhone 8/8 Plus (really a 7s, give or take) and the iPhone X, I knew I had enough of it. Everything switches over with ease to the Note 8 with the included adapters (you just plug your old phone into the Note 8 and choose what you want and bam, you have it). The camera is phenomenal on this phone and it has the ability to take photos that look as if they came out of a DSLR with quality blur (even without the live focus functionality turned on), it is so fast, I have the ability to have 2 different apps open at once and the S-Pen is great. This phone has made me so much more productive due to its highly usable functionality and I feel less reliant/dependent on my phone as notifications are much more discrete with the use of an LED and the always on display to show what app has a notification, without being distracting like the iPhone lighting up the entire screen. Seriously, I do not know why I never considered switching before. I was so convinced that Apple was the pinnacle of innovation until as of recent. They have not brought a single new and innovative feature in a long time and I think I will stay Samsung/Android for now. All I can say is if you have thought of switching over to Samsung from iPhone, give it a try. It is TOTALLY worth it. Until next time, Apple. Au revoir.",

These are the advantages iPhone & Samsung have over the other. * iPhone 8 Plus Much better voice to text recognition. Easier copy & paste feature. Easier texting & iMessage is better. Better graphics. Whatsapp picture saving, with iPhone there is no need to save the picture on your phone when viewing. This was a major disadvantage with Note 8. If picture viewed and saved to the phone, then deleted, you would not be able to access the picture again on Whatsapp. Better speakerphone. Better visual voicemail. Unlocking phone is easier with fingerprint reader on the front. Can open text messages from the front screen (with the Note 8 I wasn\u2019t able to) Touch screen is better, more accurate and more sensitive to touch. Pinpoint cursor easier. Easier to use & navigate. Less steps for an action. Google Docs stays open after use. Scroll to top of page easy. * Samsung Better camera. Gives not needed advertisements in middle of usage. Better office apps. Better for business applications. Downloads easier. More options and versatility. More customizable. Charges quicker. Battery dies slower. More prone to viruses. Internal stylus. Side bar feature is pretty cool. Please note: * There is a learning curve with either phone and I took that into account when making the above review. ** There could be things above that might be able to have been fixed, like removing advertisements from the Samsung, but I am sharing my experience since I was unable to easily take care of the issues above.",

And there is no way to disable the button. The permissions it requests make clear that this is Samsung's way to farm personal data and make the kind of money Google does from your personal information. Why else go to all the trouble to develop an app that Google perfected long ago and comes free with the phone? I also found that a promotion I was offered to induce me to buy the phone was inordinately difficult to redeem. At the store they told me to go online, once online I was told it could only be done by installing an app on the phone, and the app made it very difficult to redeem the promotion, you have to dig around, and my submission was rejected multiple times, it was really frustrating, I called tech support three times, they said things like \"Please go to the email that rejected your submission, does it say that you were rejected or that you need to resubmit?

Often mistake it as volume rocker. It lags the phone when pressed, and cause a major delay when you actually want to lower the volume. 2-AGAIN BIXBY BUTTON: makes it hard to tell which way the phone is up or down (when used in the dark). Especially, when there the physical home button is no longer present on bottom of the phone. The bixby button is position almost the same distance on the side of the phone, as the power button. 3-BLOATWARE: Samsung, needs to minimize there software. No one wants to use your email, browser and other crapware when there are superior apps are available. Even more annoying, locked phones on carries (Sprint, AT&T, T mobile, Verizon..etc.) will add even more software. So you have 3 or 4 apps that does the same thing. Many you cannot UNINSTALL. 4-FINGER PRINT SENSOR. Why did they even bother putting it where it is? Ended up dirtying the camera lenses. Take this off and pass on the saving to your consumers. Camera and the Screen are probably the 2 major incentive of buying this phone. The thin bezel isn't a game changer since your palm will block most of the edges anyways. With all this software integration, I think Samsung should just come up with their own OS at this point. They should just keep it simple and be a hardware manufacture and just keep Android CLEAN!",

                "review_text": "I have been using Samsung phones for years now. I have had the original galaxy s phone, a couple S3s, an S4, a couple S5s, a Note edge, a note 7, and now a note 8. I think this will be my last phone from them. Heres why: First of all, let me start with some good things. It is a big phone which I like and the cameras on it take absolutely wonderful photos. Its specs also make it handle a fair amount without stuttering or lagging which is nice. Its also a great looking phone. One thing to note, the phone uses gorilla glass 5 which scratches super easily so be careful. Here is why i took off 3 stars. First star was for the fingerprint reader. While I was hoping the rumors of an under-display reader were true, I wasnt actually expecting it. However, I also was not expecting samsung to place the reader in the worst spot imaginable. The fingerprint reader is located to the right of the camera. However the camera is so high up on the back of the phone that holding the device in a comfortable way means you cannot reach the reader unless your fingers are abnormally long. I am not just saying this. I do mean abnormally. I am a tall guy with big hands. I can't reach it. The other issue is for right handed people, you'll have to cross the cameras with your finger to reach the reader. This means youll be smudging your camera every time you want to attempt to unlock your phone. For all intents and purposes, this phone does not have a fingerprint scanner. Star number 2 is for the forced features. Samsung has started adding a button on the phone which triggers their voice assistant, Bixby. Unfortunately, you can not change this or even disable it which means every time you press it, it brings up bixby. You can't have it bring up the google assistant, nor can you turn it off completely.Why would you want to turn it off completely? Well the button is the perfect height to be pressed when the phone is in your cupholder or if its placed down sideways on the wireless charging stand. Another \"feature\" that bothers me is if you are using google search and you click on a link it opens it in its own little browser but if you want to do more, you have to open it in a proper browser app. Normally the google app has an option \"Open in Chrome\" Here the option is \"Open in Samsung Internet\". You can't change this. For anyone who wants to use chrome, youre basically being forced in that situation to use samsung's browser. There is also the fact that the bootloader is locked on the qualcomm versions but that doesn't apply to most consumers so it did not really affect my rating. Finally the third star is for samsung's support. God forbid you ever have to call their support to do anything. When I was trying to return my Note 7 for the recall, they initally told me they had no record of me ever sending my phone in and i wouldnt get any money back. I dug up the UPS receipt and tracking number and they suddenly found the information and were going to mail me a check. Monthly calls to samsung just left me with \"processing status\". I only received my money about 7 months after. Now I had to call in and ask a simple question about a promotion they ran for the note 8. It was about how to trade in an older phone. I called samsung and each person told me to call a different number. I was hung up on twice, and the only time I got anywhere was when I was sent to yet another incorrect department but I asked to speak to the supervisor and he was the only one who actually tried to help. My question still went unanswered because the \"proper department\" wasnt taking any calls...... Final verdict: I would not spend $900 on this phone. If I had to buy again, I would buy the Essential Phone or an Oppo One Plus 5",

They completely changed it and now it's more of a hassle than a help. The speaker...why can't Samsung put a decent speaker on their phones??? I've got an iPhone for work and it has a much more powerful speaker. You can actually feel puffs of air pushed out when it's near your face. For making calls, the Note 8 is no better than any past models. I pretty much always use my iPhone if I have to make a call. Now, in some programs it seems fine, but it's never been as good as Apple.

The fragile rounded edge of the fancy but useless \"edge screen\" hit a speaker stand on the floor and shattered. The verizon store is worthless for after sales customer service, so I had to file an insurance claim through Asurion and pay a 200$ deductible. When I get the replacement device back I am going to return it to the store and continue using my Sony Z3V. Lesson learned. Maybe I'll reconsider if they get rid of the gimmicky edge screen. I'll add a picture later if I can.",

I strongly caution other artists out there to research the s pen problems. Immediately within the hour of receiving my note 8 from my phone provider it was faulty. This is a heart sinking fact considering this phones pricetag. The s pen, no matter what art app, including the drawing & writing apps provided on the note 8, bugs out and glitches. It gets stuck and will keep writing heavy lines across the screen- even if it's not even TOUCHING the screen. During this the pen won't respond and you can not click anything, sometimes finger input does not work either. I've tried about everything, including factory reseting it again and not downloading any other apps to see if that worked. Spoiler: it didn't. This hefty review is written by someone who got the phone almost solely so I could draw on it. The other features are quite nice and so is the screen don't get me wrong. But for a phone that's the flagship writing child.. it fails. I suggest artists look into the note 5, they are beautiful things. I hope Samsung recognizes this problem and fixes it in the future.

No America just wait until they bring all colors and memory sizes to the US before buying one. Why should we be sold so short and other countries get everything regarding the colors and bite sizes for the phone. Now for that joke promotion they are offering. Well that's bad business all together. Why not just send us a check so that old not owners can put it towards a new note 8. I sure we can all figure that one out.

Every generation I hope Samsung would up the quality control and this gen it kinda did but still had some freezes. 2) I like the screen size and brightness. One of the main reasons why I got this phone. Cons: 1) Camera looks good for social media because of the brightness and and oversaturated colors but actually has very little detail when you zoom in compared to Iphone 7+ and other Android flagships such as HTC U11. Definitely nowhere near as good as the hype you see. 2) Poor battery life. OMG, the battery capacity is even less than the S8 and Note 7 which has a much smaller screen. Samsung had to default the screen resolution to 1080p although the phone is advertised as quad HD 1440p, inorder to have barely adequate battery life. Compared to other 1440p androids, the Note 8 still sucks. 3) Unless you manually change the resolution from 1080p to the advertised 1440p, the screen is not even as sharp as the Iphone 7+ and much worst than other Android flagships running at 1440p. 4) It's a Samsung phone. Historically, after a few months of use, Samsung phones start to develop bugs and lag. This uncertainty makes me uneasy.",

                "review_text": "I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus. UPDATE: 4/7/2018. The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer. 2nd UPDATE: I didn't realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options. 3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018 I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely. 4th UPDATE April 23, 2018 As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.",

I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you. One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware. I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it. It continues to nag me to use one of the apps. I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat. I already bought the phone. If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them. But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.

The phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well. While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect. In terms of it being a tool, I haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the S7 couldn't do. It comes with something called \"Bixby\" that I guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess I'm not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it... I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar. If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket. In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.",

Muzak: Am still a little confused on the various Samsung apps, esp Samsung Music which is so weird. Listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers. Size: This is a great size ... perfect for me. I am a medium build person with medium sized hands. I did not want a phablet. This phone feels like something between an iPhone 7 and 7+ for comparison. Don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iPhone +. Get a case on this thing. I am using the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle ... it's thin and grippy.",

The only thing you can not do with your carrier (you should check with yours) is that you can not get insurance on a phone unless purchased through your carrier. That being said, if I choose to get another phone, I will definitely be buying an unlocked one from here again.",

I'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout. I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device. Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps. But this is not, in any way, a downside. The speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome. I absolutely love this new phone! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone!",

You can customize it it's got so many features. It even gives you hints while using it. The phone is just awesome. And for those who are concerned about app security all you have to do is modify the apps settings. you can controll the apps access to your content and your contacts also.when I think about the price compared to an iPhone x Its so much more reasonably priced This phone is way ahead of iPhone I usually dont write reviews but this phone deserves my review Try it, you will be amazed It's an awesome phone.this phone is way ahead apple has a lot of work to do Wish I could buy this phone for everyone I know On a scale of 1 through 5 This phone deserves a 7 stars",

                "review_text": "After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day. THE GOOD: Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life. Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :) The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department. THE \"DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING\": Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity? Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place! Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone. Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense! As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it. THE BAD: The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess. Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem. Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",

I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago. I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though: Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet. If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it. (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before. Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected. The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in. The price for the phone was about average. I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies. Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES. if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user. I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing. I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook. I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.",

But after disabling Bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I'm concerned. I like the \"infinity screen\" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone. My 5X is only a bit smaller than the S9+! My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery! The 5X has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, I greatly miss that. For example when I navigate while driving I put the phone on my right knee. This new phone immediately slides right off. I'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it. I am using this phone on a Red Pocket plan with Verizon service.",

This is the best of the bunch, for certain, and there is little or no learning curve going from one to the other. They took a really good smartphone (S8), and just made it better in many ways (and, in my opinion, worse in a couple, but more on that later). Dimensions - it's extremely similar to the S8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.Visually, the screen is fantastic. The touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy. The fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the S8. Things I don't like as much - the iris scanning/facial recognition. I preferred the system in the S8 for sure. The avatars of yourself you can make from a selfie are, well, just downright creepy.",

The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market. The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues. The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either.

Display is the best currently available on any smartphone. Samsung definitely leads the game here. Sounds is stereo with Dolby, what makes it way more pleasant than iPhoneX currently. In terms of speed, it is maybe because of software, I do not play games, but for everything else I feel that Galaxy S9+ is faster than iPhone. 6 GB RAM makes lot of sense, as well. It really feels like fast computer and going back to anything slower is painful. Fast charging and wireless fast charging are added bonuses, it takes few short hours and works perfect. At current price for global market models (2 SIM cards, faster processor, 256 GB memory) and I paid 930 $, it is way better proposition than iPhone X. It is much cheaper to pay 100% for the phone and pick some smarter plan than to buy on monthly plan. Do the math. Bottom line, as convert from Apple, I may witness that Galaxy is truly an achievement, design, quality, functionality and reliability. It is all there now.",

I can honestly say that if the phone I own now, is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now (in regards to not developing glitches/issues), that it will be the best phone I have ever owned. I have never and will never own an Iphone, and I have never been a samsung anything guy in the past either. I have never liked samsung electronics (always found them 'cheaper' than competitor products). My first samsung phone 20 years ago (flip phone) was complete rubbish. My Son's Galaxy 5 (or 6?) was a nightmare. THIS PHONE however, has won me over. - Reception - best. - App speed - best. - Battery - very good. - Glitchiness - none. - Voice quality - very good. - Visuals - outstanding. The ONLY thing NOT superior on this phone vs my last is sound. I have had HTC flagship phones in the past couple of years and they are way ahead of their time with speaker/voice/sound quality. The bar was set very high with the HTC and I never expected the Galaxy to match it, nevermind beat it, BUT the Galaxy makes a valiant effort. I will miss that sound with my old phone, but if that is the only thing I have to sacrifice for an otherwise far superior phone, I can live with that. Only other concern I have is that the responsiveness to the screen, with or without a screen protector sometimes has me thinking it is not capturing my finger taps and swipes, but it is very minor (for now). I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that . I will post back after some time of using this phone to inform if it is still holding up to this gleaming review. I am on T-mobile with this phone as a point of reference. Lastly, I really wanted to buy an unbranded phone here from Amazon, but I had to buy from T-mobile because I have read that you cannot utilize the wifi calling feature with unbranded phones. While this is not a HUGE deal for me, it is a feature that while I don't use often, it would be a nice feature to have if I need it. That said, my biggest reason for wanting to buy an unbranded phone is to avoid bloatware, but honestly, this phone isn't too bad in that respect. Not that i have noticed thus far anyway.",

Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device. 4. DUAL WHATSAPP!!! 5. Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible). Same was not true ot iPhone products. 6. I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future. 7.

The S9+ is one poorly designed phone. UPDATE : The hell with karma. I went back to the Huawei Mate SE. I can be nice for only so long.",

With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently. I also love everything software wise besides Bixby I always hit it by accident coming from the Lg G6 I am used to volume down being there. But here's my issue with it the screen curve away from the viewer annoys the crap out of me if i prop my phone up with its stand to watch videos the curved part usually gets a glare and it makes the phone far less easy to protect with the screen being way more open to contact on dropping it. I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing (No Bixby) but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.",

First the curved screen is annoying if you use the phone without a case because touching these edges by mistake will block the other parts inputs plus the edges are more light reflective than the middle part so watching a movie on the gym or bright place is annoying. The second problem is that, we are in 2018 and I still don't get it why Samsung still hasn't added the \" Screen turns on by notification\" feature yet when 99% of the phones today have this feature. Lastly, the power save on the phone is still bad, If someone is new to Samsung will not know he or she needs to turn off the battery saving mode on some apps such as Gmail and Yahoo mail, or their E-mails will be arrived late.",

                "review_text": "Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both. PROs: - The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting. - Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh - Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns. - Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds. - AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone - Thin phone - 4k Video quality - Great Speakers - Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader). - Live Translations with Bixby Vision - (Plus Version) Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable - (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capture CONs: - While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated. - There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones. - What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking \"I should give Bixby a try\" - While thin, it's somewhat heavy. - Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus. VERDICT: As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.",

Not my ideal phone but it is good. Right out the box I had to make some adjustments. Deleted a slew of aps or moved them to a folder. Changed the always on display to not, because battery life is a thing I need. Phone case, yeah I got a clear one and a skin, because the downside to a phone like this is everyone has one and I don't want to advertise I have an s9+ for theft reasons. So I got it in purple because black is bi gender and purple is for girls and gays so there is less value in the black market if stolen. Got me a skin and a clear case and a film screen protector, because I don't plan on upgrading till 2020 when you know 98% screen phones will be a thing (like bro I don't need the NSA always looking at me with a front facing camera). So yeah. I mean the camera is awesome. It is literally why you get an s9+. You get an iPhone x if you are an idiot who is allergic to money and wants to blow $5000 on the app store and when your iPhone breaks you don't believe in repairing so you buy a new one, like that is cool dawg. So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah. I wish this thing had an IR blaster because jacking control over devices is useful. Like my ac etc. But I have an honor 8 to use as an ac remote when I can't find it... So that is good. I shouldn't eat at restaurant that play CNN fake news anyway, so annoying, one lady kept turning back on the TV when I kept turning it off. Like wtf yo. So I guess I can live without an IR blaster.

And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include \"Bixby,\" microphone placement, and voice recognition. First, the \"Bixby\" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled. Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down. Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone \"hears\" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words.

It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it. Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat. It has a nice screen though, but I like the iPhone\u2019s screen as much. This is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from Samsung.

                "review_text": "I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications. I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me. Decided to try S9 due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always there, making that 5\" screen more like 4.5\", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense.. Anyway, S9 notifications: No notifications on locked screen: I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen. Limited notifications on locked screen: Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app. Raise to wakeup and show notifications: With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure... Notifications while using the phone: Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup. All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ? App Icon number: Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few. Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different. Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got. Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung... All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications. Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ? Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and rarely nail a single one. First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what. Second crazy option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ? Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification. I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen; Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore. In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9. Duh.. And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge. All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9. Some notable positive sides: Samsung Internet browser is just awesome. LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-, to \"help\" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one. Starting camera with double click to Power button. Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone. Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder. Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7. --------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification: Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. Some people actually LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls. 2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them. 3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed. 3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings - \"Wake Up screen on Notifications\". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option. 4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me. I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",

But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8. I'm having so many issues with it. I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone! What are the odds? When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen. Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text. Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode. We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.

                "review_text": "I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it. The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself. This phone is fast. Don\u2019t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones. The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It\u2019s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318. This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture. This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone. The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional. In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps. Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos. The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces. The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours. The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity. Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.",

The camera in the phone working along with an app for tilt and shift produces like \ud83d\ude35. Everything on the case is glass. I can\u2019t dream of a drop and looking for a good case.",

The portrait mode is pretty cool, and even the front facing camera seems to be more clear, (less grainy). The screen is brighter, the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen. This phone is way faster than my 7. The speakers are louder also. This phone has a lot of the same specs as the upcoming iPhone x, but still feels like an iPhone. I was going to get the x, but decided that I would wait until the next generation of that phone. If you can get most of the same specs as iPhone x for less, combined with the familiarity and reliability of the iPhone we are used to, why not do that?",

                "review_text": "As a society we rely on our phones today more than ever to perform work related tasks and to expand our social network. For over 4 years I alternated between Android phones, and I believed they were high quality devices. My friends have always declared that iPhones were better, but I tended to discount them. I mean sure, iPhones have better cameras and allow group chats, but could they be drastically better than my Android? Soon enough, I bought the iPhone 8 Plus and realized just how right my friends were. The features that matter to me most when it comes to a phone are accessibility, ease of use regarding the interface, camera, screen size, resolution, and battery life. When I first got my iPhone the first thing that stood out to me was the thumb scanner. Even though it\u2019s a simple concept, I\u2019m a huge fan and prefer this over typing in a code or drawing a pattern. Overall it preserves time, albeit milliseconds it\u2019s time, nonetheless, and I find the thumb scanner to be tremendously useful. Another enticing feature of the iPhone 8 Plus is that it\u2019s waterproof in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In my 5 android phones leading up to the iPhone purchase none of them were waterproof so this was a huge upgrade for me. Now I\u2019d like to talk about the overall smoothness of the iPhone interface. Whether you are connecting to a device via Bluetooth or just surfing the web the iPhone makes things incredibly easy. For example, my last android phone always had trouble connecting to my car\u2019s Bluetooth, but the iPhone connected within 5 seconds. Overall it was effortless for me to figure out the settings, and anything I needed to find I achieved quickly with relative ease. Now I\u2019d like to talk about the camera on the iPhone when compared to Android. Every Android I\u2019ve ever bought didn\u2019t have the best camera. They were always taking blurry pictures and had a painfully hard time focusing in on things. The iPhone takes those issues away by taking extremely clear pictures with noticeably higher resolution. I\u2019m extremely satisfied with the iPhone camera and have no complaints about it. But while we\u2019re on the topic of resolution, the screen itself on the iPhone is very clear, large, and material is painless to read. One isolated issue I have with my iPhone is its battery life, I feel as if my iPhone loses it\u2019s charge rather quickly and this could be improved upon. Other than the battery life, I believe the iPhone 8 Plus to be a top-notch phone that demands respect. I would consider it my favorite phone to date and I would rate it 4.5/5 stars.",

                "review_text": "Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack? You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot). The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack. I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S. You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones. You get to have everyone hear all the map updates or Waze announcements. There is no way I'd upgrade from 7 to an 8 unless you just wanted the extra GB of RAM and faster processor. Buyer beware....",

The retina screen initially seemed worse (had an orange tint to it) than the 6 Plus from a white balance standpoint, but fortunately I learned the orange tint could be eliminated by going to Settings > Display & Brightness > adjust True Tone to the Off position. Then go back to Settings > General > Accessibilty > Display Accomodations > Cool Filters set to ON > click on Color Tint until a check symbol appears and then adjust Intensity and Hue sliders to the level of screen whiteness desired.",

Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit. Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie. Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have. Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess. Guts are virtually same as iPhone X. Probably the last of \"old-style\" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware. Will do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up xtra money for charger and stand. Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone. Best to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging).",

                "review_text": "I \"upgraded\" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not. While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5). UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more. TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees. Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their \"tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches\". iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) \"eye candy\" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder). iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say \"Hey Siri\" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated. So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads). I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates). Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, \"squircle\", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'. Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little \"hacking\" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though.",

                "review_text": "Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically. First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X. The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows: New screen (5.8\u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple) - Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus). - OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction. - Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly. - The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc. Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID - Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X. - Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom. - I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it. - This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything. - This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background. Additional noteworthy features and changes: - The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions. - Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images. - Increased audio quality and volume - Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market. - Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design. - Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing. - In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone). Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation\u2019s phones. If you have the money to spare you won\u2019t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed. Read less ***Note Carrier Compatibility: All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.

The camera is better than most new phone cameras (4K), Face ID works great for me, the all glass design is fragile, but a good case can protect it from a fall. Overall I think it is worth the price mainly because it has the best iPhone camera, the Animoji\u2019s are worth it, and because it\u2019s unique people immediately will know it\u2019s an iPhone X just from looking at the back of it.

                "review_text": "This is a cross-post review from the unlocked version, but given they are the exact same phone, I thought it would be good to post: I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down to the bullet point list. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). The price: There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there. What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",

                "review_text": "This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won\u2019t ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead. (Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up) I won\u2019t much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that\u2019s evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it. I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it\u2019s beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don\u2019t hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under \u00a38. (In 5 years I\u2019ve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear). The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed. The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used - the screen pops at you (the \u2018notch\u2019 has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it. (I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?) Battery life is the best I\u2019ve seen on a smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%. Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get. The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market. But gorgeous hardware isn\u2019t what makes a phone great - that\u2019s the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use. Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X. The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked Android offering eating dust. iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it\u2019s give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today. The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight. I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it\u2019s clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market. A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS.",

                "review_text": "Just received today so here is the low down. IMHO the best iPhone to date. Setup: simple if you happen to have another apple device running IOS 11, it is even easier. Just put the two side by side and the old will send the data to the new. I just did an icloud backup and it went through without a hitch. All my apps, data, etc was on in less than five minutes. The screen: Beautiful. The taunted Tru Tone setting in the appearance settings is nice, but for me, I preferred it off. Its a matter of taste. The loss of the home button takes a little getting used to, but is actually pretty neat, just swipe up to get to the home screen. Swipe halfway up and hold for the apps, and swipe down on the right edge to get the tool bar. Swipe, swipe, swipe. Facial Recognition. Awesome. The camera recognizes your face and turns it on instantly. Can also work with ipay etc. Great feature. Wireless Charging. Worked like a charm. I have an Anker wireless charger and it picked it up right now. Music: This one blew me away. I put the headphones, which now plugs into the charging slot,and listened to youtube. Awesome bass and volume. Better than any I recall. Turning off: This one is a tad tricky. Unlike the old ones where you just pressed the side button, now you have to press it along with with either of the volume buttons. Just takes some retraining from old habits. Animoji: Fun as heck. The way they imitate your facial expressions is really amazing. Works in i messages. Bottom line. For my first run at trying it, I am super impressed. Is it the best iphone yet? Yes, I think so. Is it worth $1,000. That depends on the individual and what they will use it for. So far, It's a keeper. One additional comment. This is wrap around glass and slippery as an eel. Get a good case and screen protector",

                "review_text": "So re how good is iPhone Ten... When I\u2019d bought it, I was a bit hesitating about it when people asked me. I thought maybe I\u2019d wasted my money a little. And I will say that I think that the only *dramatic* advantage is the size. A large screen on a much smaller phone than previously. I love that. But also, since then I\u2019ve noticed things in comparison with my iPhone 6S+. It is actually quite noticeable improvements. One of them is the speaker. It is good enough to use to listen to podcasts and audiobooks when needed. On the 6, the bass is much more noisy, so male voices do not sound great at all, quite grating. Another, which I\u2019d not seen coming, is the glass surface. I wonder how they have done it, but there must be some new treatment, because it is way less receptive to finger prints. I barely ever need to wipe it, it\u2019s great. I wish my iPads had that surface. (I also wish all the devices had better anti-reflection coating, why don\u2019t they?) Also, the colors and contrast of the screen are amazing. When the phone restarts in a dark room, I can cover the white Apple logo, and the black background is not visible! Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a \u201ctele\u201d camera (actually it\u2019s a Normal lens, the old one is a clear wide-angle). The only A/B test I\u2019ve made is night-time video, but the X blew the 6 out of the water there. None of these are must-have for most people, but it is clear that a lot of work goes into improving everything on the phones, and I think goes a ways to justify the admittedly high price for the X. And as a side-note, I have no doubt that as a business tactic, the high price is the right thing for Apple. They have to position it as a premium product, and it would not seem so if it cost only the same as the previous phone.",

The point is, if you are like me, your phone is a utilitarian device. As such the iPhone X is really not a very impressive upgrade from the iPhone 6+. Is the screen better? Yes but so what? The 6+ screen was fine and the differences, as a practical matter, are not important. It is faster but the 6+ was more than fast enough. Better cameras. Sure. But who cares? The 6+ cameras were good enough. Aesthetics are better but, again, not earth shattering and not worth a premium upgrade. The UI changes are a PIA. Sure, you can learn them but I can\u2019t say they are better - just different. Why fix something that was not broken. Battery life is not substantially different. All in all, was it worth the upgrade? Not really. This is not saying the iPhone X is not a good phone. It is but it as a practical matter, the functionality of the improvement is marginal at best. I think Apple has run out of ideas or this product category is now so mature that there is little useful innovation left to squeeze out. What would be impressive and ground breaking? Radically improved radio performance or battery life. That would make for a marked improvement in utility.",

                "review_text": "iPhone X review: This is me telling what it has been like with the iPhone X the past six days of me using the device. Feel of device: Great feel to the device , the glass back makes the device less slippery but also trades off for more fingerprints. The glass back makes it heavier then the iPhone 7 but I like that because it\u2019s feels more premium to the hand. Battery: The battery has but ok for the phone size , in a heavy user can I can get 10 hours out of the device with 5 sot. So I would it\u2019s good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery. Light user will get through a full day with no problem. Screen : What can I say this screen is the best one to touch an iPhone yet! I lover the way everything just pops at you with this display . It\u2019s on par with the Note 8 screen if not better from my personal believe. This screen is longer then the one on the 7 plus but it is not as wide as that screen and I like that but many people do not! It feels better in my hand with the more narrow screen. Speakers: They are very loud compared to my iPhone 7 Plus big upgrade. I keep them around 70% volume. It\u2019s very clear and crisp ! They ear speaker at the top is about loud as the bottom fire speaker now ! That\u2019s no exaggeration neither. No Touch ID: I forget about it completely but I did see myself reaching for it the first two days of use. Face ID: I\u2019m loving it so far! It was a learning curve though you can\u2019t put it to close or to far away from your face. I found the elbow length away from your face is the perfect position. It does work in complete darkness I tested this while and a closet a night time lol. Cameras: if you had the iPhone 7 like me the iPhone X cameras are a slight improvement with quality, The stabilization is what has improved greatly ! Everybody that has shakey hands recording I\u2019m glad to say the iPhone X is your cure. Portrait mode is great when it works ! You have to have perfectly lighting and also have to be close to the phone for it to work I hate that . When you do it get to work the results are amazing to say the least. The notch: Your eyes will naturally start to ignore it if it\u2019s not even there. Overall experience: I\u2019m liking this device and enjoying everything about , the multitasking is better now because you can just switch through apps from a left swipe from bottom of screen, One thing that is keeping me from recommending this phone is the price tag. No phone should cost $1,000 and I urge anyone only to buy this phone if you can get it at a discount and if you can get it at a bargain I would tell everybody to try the iPhone X out for a go!!",

I used to have an Android phone and after dealing with the freezing up, and it giving me issues I purchased an I phone 6s. That phone served me well and was extremely reliable. Recently it was time for me to upgrade, and I was intrigued by the look of the I phone x. I let the idea of spending a grand on a new phone stew in my mind for a month and debated getting a 8 plus instead. After spending 3 hours of testing out both the x and the 8 plus at the Apple store, I decided it was worth it for me to spend a little more for a much better phone. The ergonomics of this phone are unreal, it\u2019s super snappy and fast, never skips a beat. I have been using it for a month now and can confidently report the battery leaves nothing to be desired, the wireless charging is a treat, and I am so happy with this phone and genuinely believe the money was well spent on it.

                "review_text": "I bought the iPhone X on December 1, which was about a month after its initial release. My previous phone was an iPhone 4, so the iPhone X was quite an upgrade. There was a great deal of anticipation for the iPhone X, because it was the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. I had contemplated buying the iPhone 7 plus in 2016, but made the decision to wait another year for the highly advertised iPhone X. The criteria I evaluated while shopping for my perfect phone and will be valuable for fellow phone shoppers was Specifications, User Friendliness, and Durability. I will explain why the iPhone X was worth the wait and is a fantastic product for fellow phone shoppers! Specifications What was initially clear with my new iPhone was how sharp and vibrant the screen was. The iPhone X uses a super retina display, with 2436-by-1125 pixel resolution and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. The iPhone X was an attractive phone for me because of its upgrade from LCD technology to OLED. I am pleased with the battery life of the iPhone X, and on many occasions my phone has lasted more than a day before needing a recharge which phone shoppers could very well find as useful as I do. While researching the product I found that OLED uses energy more efficiently than LCD which is a contributing factor to the long battery life. User Friendly I quickly became comfortable using my iPhone X. Measuring at a height of 5.65 inches, a width of 2.79 inches, and a weight of 6.14 ounces; the iPhone X is long and wide enough to watch videos or read a book using the kindle app. Phone shoppers will find that It fits comfortably in your pocket, and is easy to hold in one hand. The iPhone X maximizes its size with the entire screen covering the surface area, achieved by scrapping the home button. Another benefit that I enjoy with the iPhone X is its rapid ability to recharge. The iPhone X has fast-charge capability, taking only thirty minutes to charge the battery half full which will save time for its user. Durability The iPhone X has an amazing stainless-steel frame which is thought by many to make a more durable glass. I elected to buy a case for my iPhone. Although I have not dropped my iPhone, I can confidently say that it is in as good condition as it was the day that I bought it. I also decided to pay for insurance while making my phone payment. By taking these cheap precautions, I have peace of mind that my iPhone will bring back more in value than the relatively steep price the iPhone X demands. After owning the iPhone for over two months I can confidently state that it was well worth the wait. My iPhone X has become a valuable tool for my practical day-to day needs and could very well be a valuable tool for fellow shoppers as well. Apple has delivered a thriving product that fellow phone shoppers have anticipated for over a year. If I could go back I would make the same decision again, and purchase the iPhone X. I love my new iPhone!",

If it disappeared tomorrow and I had to go back to my 6s plus, don\u2019t think I would bat an eye. But I cannot say that it is full of bugs and issues. Does take some getting used to on no home button but have not had any problems with mine. Would also suggest the lifeproof next case. Otterbox was junk in terms of how the side buttons would respond. Lifeproof slam doesn\u2019t cover the charging port and really doesn\u2019t have much water repelleing properties (yes I know the X aready has water resistant properties). Life proof next covers all ports and really works greatwith the side buttons. Plus clear back shows the exterior of the phone nicely.",

                "review_text": "I upgraded from the iPhone 6+ to the X at full price through AT&T. It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. The actual screen dimensions is about the same. Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments). Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout. I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model. The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera? I do not think so. You could purchase an even nicer camera for less. Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect. I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work. I need as close to absolute security as possible. Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity. As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops. I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two. Bad workmanship to engineering. Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation. A larger phone is anticipated with the \"X\" features but I must admit I find the \"X\" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones. The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone. Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the \"X\" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands. To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement. I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone's screen and cost a third of this phone. In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology. I am now going to do the same with my phones as well. Will try Samsung and other models for the future. Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs. Some individuals do indeed make a company great. I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo. Otherwise it is my conviction this model was put out to make money and all of us fools who fell for this are now truly paying the price. This is a turning point for me with Apple. I am done with their products. I am done with iTunes (music). \"Alexa, never order any more Apple products for me! And please play current hits and call my office.\"",

Both iPhones have refused to unlock with a passcode...sometimes crashing as many as 6 times in a row before unlocking.

The colors are a bit better than the Pixel 2 XL's, but not enough to look past the other shortcomings. The camera on the iPhone X is really cool, but for the type of photos I like to take, the Pixel 2 XL's camera wins. If I still had my iPhone 8, I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X. I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn't properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.

When the device is on the table, on the back, it actually always lies on the camera module and if you press the housing, it starts walking on a flat surface. The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand. The back panel is made of tempered glass, as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating, but the marks from the hands are clearly visible. The glass panel behind is needed for wireless charging. On the left side there is a lever, which includes a noiseless mode, below - two volume keys. On the right side, the on / off button (in fact, it's now unlocking and calling Siri), just below - the tray for the nanoSIM card. At the bottom of the right is the speaker, the second speaker is on the front panel above the screen. They work in pairs, and the volume of the sound is different, for this parameter iPhone X can give odds to many flagships, and I like it in this aspect. The microphone is on the bottom end, and also at the camera block behind. At the top end, the microphone was not placed. The noise reduction system works medium, in noisy conditions your interlocutor hears strange sounds. Places for the percentage of battery power on the display just do not. In iPhone X, the battery charge is very quickly consumed during voice calls, which is not typical for such devices. Unlike a fingerprint, you can register only one person. No way to share the phone with biometrics, only a password that can be passed on to someone. In practice, face recognition is quickly adjusted. When driving the iPhone X, the phone holder will have to be strongly shifted to the left to the handlebar, and also tilt it towards the face, otherwise no recognition occurs. I really like how the device records video (especially 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second), but this video can only be viewed on the device itself, since a new compression format is used, when transmitting all video is converted. In the maximum resolution mode, the sound is written to one microphone. In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the \"Home\" key.",

                "review_text": "I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). The price: There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there. What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",

                "review_text": "Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically. First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X. The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows: New screen (5.8\u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple) - Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus). - OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction. - Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly. - The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc. Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID - Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X. - Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom. - I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it. - This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything. - This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background. Additional noteworthy features and changes: - The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions. - Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images. - Increased audio quality and volume - Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market. - Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design. - Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing. - In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone). Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation\u2019s phones. If you have the money to spare you won\u2019t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.",

My main compliant is that my screen has a ton of scratches on it after a month of a regular use. I work in the office and I keep my phone in my pocket like most of us do. To be homesbe, my iPhkne 6s has resisted scratches for over 2 years and the X started showin scratches within the first few weeks. This is a huge disappointment and it takes away from the beautiful experience of the display. #disapointed",

I never get the latest and greatest technology. I always waited and go the \"s\" version of the new iPhone. But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever. I am so glad I did. This phone is amazing. Highlights: Great battery life. On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use. I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery. The screen is as beautiful as all the people say. I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen. The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them. Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue. I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing. Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through. They say this is the best smartphone ever, and I have to agree. Negatives: Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective. And you should be. But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month. I don't find that to really be a negative. I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet. This is a truly awesome phone.",

Given that, I took the plunge and since needing a phone, went with the \u201cfuture proof\u201d X. It was between the 8+ or X but given the display on the X I made the move. Do I regret it? Pros: Amazing display Exceptionally fast Beautiful design and form factor (bigger display but smaller form is very helpful) Videos are outstanding Camera is world class and photos amazing Wireless charging very helpful Cons: Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoying Battery life is ok, not great, but not on par with 8+ Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require it Design is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that design Let me just say that despite it\u2019s amazing display, I should have gone with the 8+. The Face ID is just not on par with fingerprint sensor. It works, but requires the extra step of swiping up after looking at it. Maybe I\u2019m just being way too picky but when you are used to just placing your thumb and opening instantly every time, it\u2019s the one thing they just drives me crazy. You get used to the other gestures but again, just not as simple as using the 7 or 8. Would I buy it again? Probably not especially at the cost and extra $250 vs the 8+ which doesn\u2019t have the screen of the X but pretty much everything else. While maybe not a big deal to some, I just can\u2019t get past the Face ID being more of a gimmick then a necessity and I fear that\u2019s the future of all iPhones like removal of the headphone jack.",

Android haters like to bash on apple for removing the headphone jack adding the notch (which is barely noticeable) but if you look now there are a lot of phones copying the notch from apple? You tell me. I don't like android because it's buggy. Sure it might run well on super expensive phones like pixel 2 or samsung but it still crashes more often than IOS does. I buy apple phones because of the simplicity of the IOS (not that I'm dumb or can't handle android, I build my own gaming computers).

My iphone 7 plus was more advanced than this garbage phone. At this price point I expected much more, I will end up buying the Galaxy s9 plus for now or keep my iphone 7 plus. This phone is a huge disappointment i canf believe they didn't offer a plus size version, this is just Apple's way to grab more money from consumers when they release their next model. I cant recommend this phone to anyone with this price tag, its maybe worth $600 max. My advice would be wait for the next model or buy another phone brand if you really need to upgrade",

                "review_text": "Late last year Apple released their iPhone X, the 10th generation iPhone and the flagship of their line-up. When it was first announced in September 2017, there was a lot of media coverage and many people were excited for it to go on sale. It was possibly the largest change to an iPhone the world had seen, and I had to get it. Sadly, I missed the online pre-order date, therefore I ended up on the second floor of the Galleria Mall parking garage at 10:30 pm wrapped in a sleeping bag on a lawn chair. After an 11hr and 33-minute wait, I finally was able to hand Apple $1400 for the phone. But was it worth it? I love the software and user interface apple generally produces. However, for the price I paid for this phone I expected it to have a bit more of a \u2018Wow-factor\u2019, in terms of the \u2018evolutionary\u2019 technology that the device was advertised to possess. I do think that this device is a platform for them to build a lot of new and innovative technology off of, however, despite my excitement for that, the reality is that I spent a lot of money on an iPhone that doesn\u2019t do that much more than the previous generation. The features I enjoy include: the new Face ID biometric security feature, the beautiful OLED edge-to-edge display, the incredible camera quality, wireless charging and water-proof feature. That being said I don\u2019t think this phone was worth the price, much more the iPhone 8 and not significantly better. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do love the device, just as much as a love most products apple produces. When it comes to value however, value defined as the worth of something compared to the price paid or asked for it, I am not sure if I consider this item to be of good value. Initially, when I saw the launch event followed by the numerous exhilarating, colorful, dynamic ads I was under the impression that this phone would provide new user experiences using the augmented reality (AR) technology built in to the device. The camera is just as good, if not better than I expected it to be and I often find myself in a dilemma due to the incredible quality, I no longer need to carry around my professional DSLR camera. Face ID: the new facial biometric scanner in the iPhone X is astonishing. It projects 30,000 invisible dots on your face, mapping the 3D dimensions which creates a high security level, despite some negative criticism the system has gotten. The phones new edge-to-edge OLED display is the most beautiful display I\u2019ve seen on an iPhone, with high ranges of crisp colors and incomparable resolution. I am a sailor so I am at sea a lot, and near bodies of water. Having the iPhone X be waterproof has been a long-awaited feature for me and I really feel more comfortable having that feature. Wireless charging is an emerging technology that is interesting to me, although it isn\u2019t any more convenient than plugging in a cord, or even less convenient in some ways I had to buy the wireless charging pad just due to my interest in new technology. However, I do often find myself plugging in the cord so that I can use the phone while it\u2019s charging. I am a huge fan of apple and an avid iPhone user, however when it comes to value I just don\u2019t think this phone was worth the $1400 I paid for it and the 12 hours wait in line. There are some features I love such as the great Camera, Face ID, the display and the waterproofing but I expected much more off of the AR capabilities and \u2018evolutionary technology\u2019 that this phone was advertised to have. Who knows, maybe this really is a platform for them to build something really great off of, time will tell but in about 8 months the next iPhone will come out and mine will become outdated yet again. Currently, I don\u2019t feel I have gotten the value out of the device that I expected upon buying it.",

Finally arrives on the 6th and I don\u2019t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I\u2019ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn\u2019t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it\u2019s a Saturday and he\u2019s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn\u2019t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that\u2019s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it\u2019s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I\u2019ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I\u2019ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I\u2019ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I\u2019d have to say I\u2019m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...",

                "review_text": "iPhone X \u2013 A phone from the future Making the jump from the iPhone 7 plus to the iPhone X was a big decision to begin with, how much could change in just one year? Well to the surprise of many (or maybe not) Apple once again crushed this phone. All of the enticing new tricks and treats tucked inside this amazing looking phone was everything Apple users hoped for and more. To review this product all of the following will be taken into account, innovation, battery-life, design, durability, cost, and operating system. To begin, the ideal user that would buy this phone would be someone with an interest in technological innovation, an overdue upgrade for their current phone, or someone with the desire to just experience what Apple truly stands for, \u201cto design the best personal computers in the world.\u201d One of the only downsides that you may experience with this phone is the price tag. Ringing up at $1,132.00 for the 64 GB and $1,296.96 for the 256 GB may leave a dent in your wallet. Excluding the price tag on this sleek and attractive phone, it is perfect for a user who is constantly checking, or on their device. With the new adaptions to the iPhone X you will now be able to implement the seamless opening and surfing of apps with face recognition as well as fluid finger swipes. Even while boasting these streamlined new tools, the iPhone X also holds a 19.5-hour battery life. Almost double the battery life of the previous iPhone 7. So, if you\u2019re a business man or woman, student, or avid technology guru, you will be pleased with the care and effort put forth into making this phone one of a kind. Moving on to the design and innovations of the phone. You will now be able to unlock your phone with the most unique thumbprint of all, your face. This allows for easy unlocking, as well, it can be used to make purchases and log onto various apps or websites while surfing the internet. Along with this is the removal of the home button. Though it took a while to get use to this change, overall it was a positive step forward. To get home on your phone now you simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen, quick and easy. Following the patterns of innovation stated above, the new iPhone X carries a dual 12MP sensor array as well as improved aperture and wide angle lens that is supported by image stabilization. This makes for perfect pictures, all the time. Not to mention the video capabilities have improved to include 60p 4k video recording, allowing for some of the best phone recorded videos ever. For the interiors of the phone, Apple has increased the RAM on the phone up to 3GB, allowing the iPhone X to be one of the fastest phones on the market. When it comes to durability and cost, you may be a touch disappointed, though it must be pointed out. With the front and back of the iPhone X being glass, one drop will lead to a pricy fix (upwards of $700). Though the glass is now better quality and more durable, a drop can lead to serious costs. Some would argue that the price tag on this phone should alleviate some accidental drop costs but with quality comes price. With the potential for a costly drop, you are able to buy a case along with newly designed durable screen cover that can save you from the $700 down the road. In conclusion, this is the best phone you would be able to purchase at this time when considering reliability, innovation, and usability. Apple once again did a fantastic job designing this phone and if you\u2019re on the fence about the purchase there are many options to upgrade or a 2-year payment plan with built in AppleCare. Overall this could be the phone that changes your perception of what a phone is and what a phone can do.",

I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc. This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off. I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue. Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues. Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects??? It's more than that. I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy. The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan. The face recognition is awful. I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern. If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off. A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it. These are all legit concerns. Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done. I am truly disappointed. I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine. The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues. Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x.",

I was also worried about the impact of Face ID which beams infrared laser dots into my eyes 30 times a day (10,000 times a year). I prefer the rectangular screen of the 8 to the one on the X with its curved corners and weird inset. Best of all, I can orientate my iPhone 8 simply by feeling the touch ID button - even in the dark or in a pocket. I can also see exactly how much battery percentage I have left, and closing apps is a snap compared to the X. The iPhone 8 is brilliant - it's fast, simple and familiar to use. By comparison, the iPhone X feels gimmicky because its so-called innovations make it harder to use.",

                "review_text": "Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10. TL;DR Gorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear AND front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and Bluetooth 5.0! On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback. It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience. CONS: 1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations. It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though). It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches. A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1). 2. Samsung is not very good with software updates. If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels. That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone. 3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times. Yes, I wish it was on the front. No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story). You know, we have this thing called \"muscle memory\".. It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems. If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8) 4. The phone has glass back that\u2019s prone to cracking, so watch out if you\u2019re clumsy. But see pro tip #1 5. S8 doesn\u2019t have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day. If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere. 6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera. Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG). An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6) UNIQUE ADVANTAGES 1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone. This doesn\u2019t really improve the functionality of the phone, but there\u2019s just something satisfying about this futuristic experience. 2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here. Always-on display is useful. 3. As of today, it\u2019s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0! 4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing. S8 is a first phone to come with this, and it\u2019s awesome. I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room. You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones. 5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet. PRO TIPS 1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (they\u2019re better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back. The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if you\u2019ve dropped your phone. Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that. Don\u2019t use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone! 2. Bixby is useless, and if you\u2019re like me, most \u201cSmart\u201d assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns. You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/ 3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you don\u2019t know what I mean) 4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life 5. Set screen resolution up to QHD. In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use. Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot. 6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20. They\u2019re less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside they\u2019re much more versatile and fun. 7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait. Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites. 8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast. In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be. If you wear glasses, register with glasses on. Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions. You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments. It's a really nice phone, highly recommended.",

                "review_text": "Don't get me wrong, it's a good phone. Battery life is good, and the display quality and camera are second to none. Unfortunately, there are a number of things about this phone that are so annoying that I'm looking to replace it a month after purchase. Granted, I'm kind of a phone snob, so these things might not bother others as much as they did me. So make this short, I'll make a list: -The curved screen means constantly missing buttons that are on the side of the screen. Good luck if you're playing a game. Alongside this, anything displayed is distorted along the sides. So TV shows and movies suffer. The side menu is (very) occasionally helpful, but hardly justifies the issues caused by the edges. If this is the alternative, then just include the side bezels. Really, the whole thing amounts to more of a novelty than something actually worthwhile. It's supposed to save space, but it doesn't. Which leads me to my next point: -This phone is huge. If you're looking for a normal-sized phone, this isn't one, despite being the smaller of the GS8's. Reaching across the screen requires constant repositioning and stretching. And if you have a case on it, it's a giant lump of tech in your pocket. Also: -The 18:9 resolution is pointless. Not only is every video ever shot in 16:9, but there's no way to globally keep the navigation bar displayed. If there was, the 18:9 display would be inconsequential (since you'd effectively have a 16:9 display). But since there isn't, you have a larger display area, but have to swipe up to show the navigation bar constantly. There seems to be some way to make it stay on screen on a per-app basis, but I've yet to figure out how. Reaching the status bar without repositioning your hand is hopeless, even with big hands. -Samsung's software is still incredibly laggy and bloated. After using a Pixel (1) for over a year, everything about it seems slow. Apps, games, web pages all load surprisingly slow for the hardware this phone is running, and scrolling constantly stutters. -The worst thing about this phone? The fingerprint sensor. Since Apple (Not a fan, but credit where it's due) pretty much perfected this tech a few years ago, it's been a pretty standard thing in the mobile world, and one that's expected to just work. But on the GS8, it's just abysmal. The sensor is in a terrible spot, is small and awkwardly shaped, and requires your finger to cover the entire sensor to work. So if your placement is even a little off, it won't work. It makes unlocking this phone a chore every. single. time. So every time, you have to approach the sensor from the top or bottom (it's rectangular). All this being said, there are a few features that I like about this phone. The always-on display is something that I really like about my GS7, and missed with my Pixel. (There are ways to have it with root, but nothing beats having something stock) Pixel and Nexus phones only allow tethering if you have a subscription through your provider (can override with root), but the GS8 has the check disabled stock, which is nice. The sheer number of people that have these phones makes rooting and DMverity defeat very easy. Overall, I think Samsung is starting to pull an Apple, where they're getting overly confident in their position in the mobile market and have turned to form over function. I've had a lot of phones over the years, starting with the original iPhone and averaging about a phone a year, and this is the first one that I immediately disliked (I do a lot of research before buying something that costs $600+). I'll probably be getting a Sony Xperia XZ2 compact (god their naming sucks) whenever I can get one for a decent price. The Z3 was one of the best phones I've owned (behind of course, the Nexus 5), and it seems like it's the phone I was hoping the GS8 would be.",

The alerts(test, amber, etc.) cannot be turned off with this foreign firmware. Even if they say they're turned off, they will come through whenever they're sent, think about it.This is my issue with the phone for the software, I come from having a note 3 and a note 5, I am basically spoiled by the notes, the screen is better in that I don't have to worry about a beveled screen. That aspect of the screen DOES alter how what you're looking at appears there. I do a lot of reading, its annoying to have the screen like that.",

The fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it's usable. it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and I have big hands. I love the pairing with the S3 Gear and the Samsung Health App. It has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode. I miss the dedicated silent button from the iPhone this needs to be UNLOCKED before I can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary Bixby button. There should be a silence button instead of that. The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it. Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8. Hope they'll come out with something better and I also hope Samsung LISTENS to users. We don't want the Bixby. We want to be able to remap and reconfigure anything this coudl be your true ace vs iPhone that will never allow it.",

Many games do not support Mail GPU, Like you use AMD graphics to play large 3D games it will has a lot of problems such as reboot, not support Anti-aliasing, Cannot open in-game special effect. Exynos is 14nm=8890, 10nm=8895 & 2.3+1.7GHz But Qualcomm is 10nm & 2.35+1.9GHz, Able to run at a higher frequency for more stable time. And the most important thing, The International version Exynos 8890 or 8895 Only support GSM unlock, But US version Qualcomm 835 Unlock the entire network CDMA and GSM, Meaning that you can use this phone at any network company in the world.",

I did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so I still have the service plan for next month. Switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters. Although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but I had no clue what many of the passwords were. As I was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it. The mains charger has European prongs but I have many USB wall chargers so no big deal. The factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones. But the phone itself is a dream compared to an S5. So much quicker and no lags",

                "review_header": "Worst Customer Service Ever",
                "review_text": "So, let me start off by saying that I really did love my expereince overall with this phone. It's fast, pretty, and top of it's class. That was until one day, my phone began to crash randomly throughout the day. I thought maybe it just needed a reset, so I did just that. The problem persisted yet, so I have Samsung a call, and this is where my experience with Samsung was shot down, strangled, and ground into dust. It began with my first couple customer calls, I followed all of their data reset regulations and yet the issues were still going on. So, they stated I needed to send the phone in and have it looked at and fixed before they could do anything else (which was totally fine with me the first time). I asked them about a loaner phone while mine is repaired, and they stated that my carrier provides that and they do not. So, I called my carrier and they stated that Samsung provides that and they do not. Very frustrated with that I called back and was told Samsung could not do anything, so I was stuck with a hand me down Iphone, but it is just a temporary phone, Right?...Wrong! but Ill get to that later. After waiting the 1.5 weeks to have my phone repaired and sent back I smiled as I opened the box and restored my phone, finally I could just get back to using it again. Skip ahead 12 hours when the issue is still happening! So I message there online care center using there online chat and there service representative informs me that if it is not working again, they will most likely get me an exchange device. They tell me to call the Executive care staff, but in order to get to them you must speak with their first level of customer service EVERY SINGLE TIME! No matter what you tell them or who's name you drop they always need the whole story and waste 30 minutes of your day before informing you that they need to escalate you to their executive customer care department (No lie, this happened to me every time I called until I stated I refuse to talk to them). Now, after that I spoke with a executive care assistant (ECA). They informed me that the person who told me that I could get an exchange was wrong and that there needs to be multiple repairs on a device before it can be exchanged and that it needs to be sent in AGAIN! Frustrated with the broken guarantee I asked to speak with a supervisor, the supervisor stated the same stuff that the ECA said but did state she could get me expedited shipping (Woohoo...). So again I packed my device and drove to a UPS and dropped it off, dreadfully sliding my sim card back into that Iphone. This time it only took 1.2 weeks (wow, what a difference) to get my phone back, and upon looking at the service receipt I noticed there was nothing marked as to what they performed, shrugging I thought maybe they just forgot. I restored my phone once more and yet again, it crashes not even 1 hour later. So a little peeved I call again (and go through the 30 minutes of the first representative :D) and after speaking with the ECA she states that it looks like they did a software update (rightttttttt) and then sent it back. I inform her that it is still having these issues, she then informed me that it still does not qualify for an exchange because there was not anything repaired the last time I sent it. Trying to control myself I ask her if there are any other options aside from sending it in again for weeks. She states sadly no and that she has no idea if I will ever be able to actually get an exchange or refund because it has to meet \"repair criteria\", again I angrily pack my phone up and ship it, waiting another 2 weeks to get my phone again because of the holidays. So I open the package when I get it back and don't even reset the piece of crap Iphone because I knew that it was going to happen once more. I guess right! The phone crashed again and again. So i call once more and this is were I just refuse to speak to the 1st level of help, sensing my frustration and probably looking back at my last couple notes they pass me along. Finally I am offered the exchange I wanted from November 2017. Mind you it is now the end of January! I give them all the information, give them all my receipts (which I luckily still had) and they stated they will email me with a shipping label and directions. So, I wait yet another week for them to contact me, puzzled I call them and they stated they have nothing in their system about an exchange. Taking a nice cleansing breath I try to not explode on this poor representative who can surely tell that I am not happy. At this point I demand a refund, the representative tries to persuade me otherwise but at this point I would never want to deal with this ever again if I have an issue down the road. So, she states that she will start the refund process, around 1.5 hours later she states it has been submitted and I will receive info within 2-3 business days. So, giving them a break I wait the full 3 days, and guess what? Still no emails or calls. I call again and I informed that they having nothing in their system about a refund, just information about an exchange. I laugh into the phone and say they must be joking, the ECA stated she is very sorry but they have no record and we must restart the process once more. I swallow my anger, trying to be a sensible and caring man and begin this 2 hour process once more, and this ECA gives me her direct line and email after the process is finished and states she will email me with updates to ensure that I get it done in a timely manner. So, I send my phone in once again! and this is in February at this point! Waiting a couple of days and not hearing anything I just email her, asking for an update, no answer! I try again a day later, and no answer once again. I give her direct line a call 2 times in 1 day and leave a kind message just asking for an update. Two days later I have yet to hear anything. So I call there ECA department once more and I am told that it can take 7-14 business days or 7-21 regular days for a refund to be issued. I tell them it has been nearly 2 weeks since my 1st attempt and over 1 week since I sent the device in and they just tell me that it is pending and I need to wait. So, I wait another 4 days, still no updates from anyone, my package tracking has been at there warehouse for over a week now because I can see it on UPS's website. I call very upset and speak to yet another ECA, he stated that he is sorry, and was confused as to why they have had it a week and why it was still pending. He informs me that the process has yet to even start. At this point I am frustrated yet again and demand to speak to a supervisor, he tries to tell me they can't do anything special, but at this point I need to let someone know my frustrations with this whole process. So, he transfers me and upon someone picking up they just hang up on me. So, I call again and I am told by the 1st level that the ECA told them that they have done all they can for me at this moment and that I need to wait (uh no, I am speaking to someone about this because at this point I deserve to be listened to), I wait on hold for over an hour to speak to the 1st level supervisor who literally picks up and tells me that she just needed to see what was wrong before she could transfer me. So, she transfers me and I wait another 45 minutes before speaking to the ECA supervisor. He tells e he is sorry and that he would personally email the refunds/exchange department to have my refund \"expedited\" I ask him to let me speak to them because it has been over 2.5 weeks since my initial call and I am paying for a phone that I haven't been able to use for months now. He informs me that they do not take calls and they can only be contacted by ECA through emails. Frustrated I hold my tongue and ask him for his direct line and email, he gives it to me and tells me to call him for any questions or updates and that the refund'exchange dept should get back to him that day and he would let me know their response. Nothing comes that day, or the next, or that week! So, I try to call that supervisor, no answer and I leave a message, no response 2 days later. I call yet again and jump through the hurdles and hoops, I am told that they are having issues with their computer system and that their accounting dept was closed the day before and that my refund is still pending (WHAT?!?!) I laugh yet again (because at this point I am just so shocked at how horrible this service is) and I am informed that I need to call again in 24 hours to see where it is at. At this point I am on day 19 of the 21 days they guaranteed (although from all the false guarantees I have gotten from them, I doubt it will be on time). I inform the ECA of this and she asks me to just be patient and \"they are doing their best\". I still have yet to get my money back, I am still paying for this phone which I literally have not been able to use since November. I have wasted HOURS of time speaking to this company and their service is so poor I can safely say that Samsung will not be a brand in my life or my families life. I hope that someone from this company gets to see this and fixes the issues. I hope that someone considering buying this phone reads this and takes into account what will happen if an issue arises. A multi- billion dollar company should not be making a customer jump though hoop after hoop to resolve a mistake THE COMPANY made. I just want to state that I normally am very understanding of mistakes and I have a great deal of patience for human error. But when a mistake happens over and over and when a promise is broken nearly every time there comes a point when your experience needs to be shared and the issue needs to be resolved. I also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues, but I am a working Father who doesn't have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective. I hope this is helpful to people and thanks for listening to my rant!",

Charging this phone is not as fast as some other phones like oneplus 3, honor 8 or the axon 7. but you have wireless charging which makes up for it. The headphones included in the box are great as well. The fingerprint scanner location is not an issue for me, I have a case on and it's not difficult to reach but it does take some getting used to. The camera is also one of the best right up there with the google pixel. The sound is pretty good, not amazing like stereo speaker phones but its loud and clear enough. it's easy to use with one hand even though it has a huge 5.8-inch screen thanks to the new 18.5 by 9 screen aspect ratio and the 84% screen to body ratio.",

They fixed the problem that I had with the Galaxy S7 Edge that I often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the \"edges\" of this screen anymore. I have a Google Pixel XL and I'm going to switch for the Samsung Galaxy s8, not the S8+, because even with my big hands I have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the S8+. The screen of the S8 is even bigger than the Google Pixel XL by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the Pixel XL. In terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the Google Pixel XL, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. You can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market. Pros: -Design -Wireless Charging -Latest processor -Bluetooth 5.0 -Mobile HDR Premium technology -No problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently. -water/dust resistance IP68 -Good battery optimization -USB Type-C -headphones 3.5mm input -AKG earbuds included -Great quality camera -Beautiful display (image) -USB Type-C to USB adapter included -USB Type-C to USB adapter included -Pay safely virtually at any store with Samsung Pay (something that Apple Pay and Android Pay can't do) -Comes already with Android 7.0 Nougat -Expandable storage via MicroSD Card. Cons: -Comes with 64GB of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the MicroSD card -No unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like Google Pixel and Pixel XL) -Fingerprint in one of the worst places possible. -Sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)",

The buttons for volume and for Bixby are almost directly opposite to the power button. This is the worst design ever. As a result, trying to turn off the screen is an extreme pain and usually results in a photo of my hand or activating Bixby or changing the volume. My old iPhone had a good design, with the power button on top. I'd have moved back to Apple, but can't stand the restrictions, like on managing music. The phone is a bit faster than the S7, but I have trouble with it responding to my touch. That could be a symptom of the screen protector causing interference though. I am not a fan of the curved edges, preferring the flat screen. The display quality is great. The fingerprint scanner is inconvenient, but I knew that was the case going into this phone.",

And I mean they REALLY can't hear a thing and get annoyed with me since I refuse to put the phone to my ear for safety reasons. Super annoying when watching to youtube because the EDGE feature is too sensitive and all phone covers are designed to NOT cover up the edges. The youtube program changes if you fingers get within 1/16th of an inch of the edge of the screen. How do you hold the phone and not get anywhere near the edge? You don't actually have to touch the screen to change youtube programs. Then there is no BACK button to get back to youtube I was just watching. Other phones have a BACK button. Screen is way too sensitive. Even setting phone face down on electrical wires will change youtube program. Putting phone in pocket while youtube is playing changes the youtube channel 100% of the time no matter how careful I am to not touch the screen. I do not watch youtube in full screen... usually searching for next video while one is playing. Another super totally annoying feature is screenshots. You have to hold down the volume down button and the power button at the same time..90% of the time the volume just changes and no screenshot.... or screenshot with volume bar showing.

A lot of people complain about the location of the fingerprint scanner, which does take some getting used to. But keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner. Hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device. See what I mean? I found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone. Unfortunately, there was something I couldn't get past with this particular model. The edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight. I almost switched back to my iPhone 7 plus, but after using the S8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky! If you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus. If you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you! Also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker. When you're outside, the color stands out a lot more. Update: after spending 3-4 days with the s8 plus, I ended up switching back to the s8. The Verizon reps were super helfpul in assisting me throughout this process!",

One week after my phone arrived, it slipped from my lab, falling two feet to the stone floor, shattering my screen. Never in the past eight years have I ever cracked a screen, and I cracked the s8 within a week. Don't believe me? Look up stress tests for the s8, and you'll see it performs worse compared to previous phones. Pros: 1. Nice camera 2. Great battery life 3. TONS of storage space Cons: 1. Breaks far too easily 2. Fingerprint scanner not located in a convenient location, and it usually takes ~10 tries to get the phone to even recognize my fingerprint. 3. The virtual home buttons disappear in some apps, making it annoying to try to close the app quickly. 4. There is an extra button added to this phone below the volume buttons for something called \"Bixby\" which advertises itself as being some sort of virtual planner, providing the option to do an amazon search for something using image recognition. It's a cool concept, but I'm always pressing the button when I don't want to see it, and the image search feature is just a commercialized use of computer vision.",

I was then locked out of my phone and my nightmare began. I opened a trouble ticket with Samsung support and followed their instructions for verifying ownership of the phone. They failed to follow-up with me and when I called back to check the ticket status, I was told the ticket was created incorrectly so they had to close and re-open a new ticket. They asked me to wait another 24 to 48 hours for resolution. The time elapsed and again they failed to follow-up with me. I called back and was told they needed another 24 hours. Once again no follow-up. I called back and was told the ticket was closed because the receipt I had emailed them did not contain enough information for verification of ownership. I now have a third ticket opened, have sent them 3 emails containing information they requested and still cannot use my phone. I can only say I have enjoyed the Samsung products I have purchased until this recent experience, but in the future I will consider the quality of support when buying my electronics.",

The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography. It blows away apple in my opinion, Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc's. It also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple. Any android can be plugged into any PC without a problem with no software to clog up your PC. The processor is killer,4 gig of ram! And I was sold on the camera immediately. Being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.The battery is OK but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick. But this can be controlled, Power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabs on the battery. It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in. I can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price? the s8 and s9 at least for a while. I give the s8 5 stars!!!",

Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power. I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased. Below is my list of pro and con. Pro: Decent Camera, good with low light environment. Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past. Support wireless charging, water-proof. Less overheating. It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold. Con: Unusual Screen ratio. Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market. This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing. Overall, I think this is a good phone.

                "review_text": "For clarification I have the U.S model of this phone with the snapdragon processor. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because frankly I could talk about this phone all day. I've had this phone for a few months now and am now ready to review it, I'll break down this review into build quality, screen quality, weight, audio quality/call quality, processor speed, camera quality, battery life and ease of navigating the software. - Build quality is outstanding, the phone looks and feels as good as it gets.The phone is a little slippery though so I do recommend a case for it, more on that later. -Screen quality- This is by far the best display I have ever seen on a phone, samsungs amoled display technology is at the top of its game. Colors pop,contrast is incredible and the blacks are truly black and because of the curved screen the content you view on it whether its photos or videos has an almost 3d effect to it. Samsung also offers display adjustments in phone options if you want more neutral colors instead of the saturated colors amoled is known for, either way this display is top notch! Weight- Suprisingly light weight for how sturdy it feels. The S8 feels good in pocket and won't have you wishing you had a lighter phone anytime soon. Audio quality/ Call quality - Audio with this phone is above average but not the best, music, movies, games all sound good whether you're using head phones or the phone speaker, the phone speaker does distort at high volumes though, but you'll most likely be using headphones anyway. The included earbuds that come with the phone were very good (at least before they shorted out) so heads up on that, also I'd recommend a eq app like power amp if you want to fine tune your sound. Call quality on the other had is hands down phenomenal, I've made a lot of calls with this phone and have constantly been blown away with how crisp and clear the calls are. Processor Speed- Calling this phone fast is an understatement, I've tried my best at times to get this phone to slow down and just can't do it. Everything is snappy and instantaneous whether youre opening an app or loading a web page. This phone doesn't break a sweat! Camera quality - The camera on this phone is fantastic, the photos are amazing, with one downside low light photos fo have more noise than I'd like in them. I'll attach some example's to this review so you can see for yourself. This phone won't replace a high end dedicated camera, but you could do a lot worse. Battery Life - I have to give credit to both Samsung and android for this one. The battery life on this phone is outstanding, i can get two and a half days out of this phone easy. I'm pretty easy going on my phone though, I wouldn't call myself a power user by any means, but I didn't put this phone through its paces a couple times and and came out impressed, even with heavy usage and screen brightness turned all the way up this phone made it through a day and a half of nothing but videos, web surfing, and music playing with battery to spare. If you need even more run time, you can put the phone into varying degrees of battery saving modes that can squeeze out even more run time ( the emergency mode can give you months of battery time, granted you can't do much else besides make calls but it could be a life saver). Ease of navigating software - Short answer is its cake. The long answer is its intuitive and ridiculously easy to move around in menus and find what you are looking for. Samsung has really out done themselves here and it shows. Honestly I can't think of a single negative about the software, it's done so well. Now, for the drawback I mentioned earlier in the review. Finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works, and doesn't impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen, even otter box doesn't have on that works. You can always buy one of the wallet type cases to cover the screen, it'll help avoiding damage. Of course if a screen protector isnt a big deal for you then you're golden. The phone does have the latest and greatest gorilla glass 5 on it so scratches really aren't an issue I've noticed zero on my phone. The wallet case I have on my phone has held up well and protected my phone from a couple of drops I'll be reviewing that shortly. I don't count this against the phone because this isn't really big deal to me but it might be to you, at the end of the day this phone is incredible and if your in the market for a phone the S8 should be at the top of your list.",

From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10, until I found the Note 7, too bad it was recalled, went on the hunt again, or was it then that I got the XZ?, anyway ended up with the Google Pixel, which though very good, still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note. Back to this S8 here. I'm gonna just mention the basics, coz I see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, I'll try to answer from experience! - The edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out. I really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp! Any picture, movie, YouTube video looks just better on this screen. - The camera is just great! While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, I still think this S8 is a little better. - Games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat. - The size is just perfect, and the weight too! It feels as big as my Google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! ) iWas gonna get the S8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the S8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too. -The battery is nothing special, I can say I'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day. Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days I didn't need to. You'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now. I absolutely it love it and I think you will too!",

A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8 screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay, I don't know what shops charge. You can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone",

In the past week or so I have fallen in love with this phone the extra little features are awesome. the finger print scanner on the back of the phone was a bit weird to me at first but now that i have gotten a bit more used to it I think it is a nice change. making it easier to unlock your phone as you take it out of your pocket. all in all the device deserves a 4/5. i will explain the reason i think it should get a 4/5 and there is only one issue. If i could give the the device a 4.5 I would but that is not how amazon works. I have one single complaint. the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used. at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again. just recently Samsung REMOVED the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant Bixby. since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is Bixby. doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device. It is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen.",

Bought S8 and I had to say it is the worst Galaxy I've owned. The main issue is screen that cracks SO easily. I didn't even drop the phone, I sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack. In a few more days I got a few more cracks. There is absolutely no value in the \"infinity\" screen, it's beautiful but worthless. In my 8 years of owning multiple Galaxies I only cracked the screen once, and I dropped it many times. S8 has a design flaw. Then there's Samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you. Bixby is useless but you can't disable it. It wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps... What a piece of garbage! Samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than Google's but they enable it by default. At least Samsung has accepted my return and out of loyalty I bought S7 which I am much happier with.",

The screen on my OP2 cracked, so I decided to splurge and got myself this beauty. In retrospect, I should have just repaired my OP2's screen. The S8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment. It gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion. The curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car. A lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location. It's not ideal, but I've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me. Android purists will not be happy with the fact that Samsung tries to force their \"Google Now\" clone called \"Bixby\" onto the user. It is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as \"Google Now\" does. They have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else. a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - Otherwise, I would have gotten an Iphone, had I wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things. Some very common widgets (Such as Google Keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio. The all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another. Ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty. The display and camera are nice, but that's not something lacking in most modern phones.

I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it. My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out. The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same. After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly. I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it. The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia. I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone. There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc. I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc. This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month.",

Unfortunately it happened to me just as it apparently has happened to many other users (if you google galaxy s8 cracked screen, you will find many results) So even though all the rest of the phone is outstanding, I would never ever buy it again as it will not even last even a month. My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 USD and that I know I would have to repair it again just a few weeks later. Of course, I have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily. I have been a faithful Samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately I will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of LG, Sony or HTC now. PS: The stunning Edge-Glass-Infinity-Screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem. I guess one has to decide between the most beautiful and most breakable phone, or an a little bit less beautiful but more robust phone.",

Shame on Samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the Bixby button to something else.. The Battery is O.K. but not great and for the money I think the phone should have 6Gs of RAM. Screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that Samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the Note 7. All in all I really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you. **6/2/17 ** I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U.S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!! They originally said it would be up and working in the spring and now they are delaying it again. This makes this phone a great BETA device but definitely not ready for Prime time!! It's like a great looking sports car that can t go past 70 miles per hour!! really!!! and they dedicated a button to something that they can't get to work!!

First off let me say how great the battery life is. I'll provide a real life example of use. I took it off the charger at about 3pm on 4/27/17. I texted, watched videos, surfed the web for a few hours, played a high graphics game & live streamed on youtube for an hour and the phone is only at 50%. Thats a lot of use for about 12 hours. I loved the S7 edge and this is everything and extra. The screen is outstanding and cant say enough good things about this phone. Its exactly what you want out of a phone plus more. Sure its a lot of money, but you're paying a good price for something simply amazing. If you have the cash, just buy it. It's well worth it.",

                "review_header": "A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones",
                "review_text": "Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers. A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production. I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile). Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6. This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate: displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com) How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird. This is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of. Even LG's unique G6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). I really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8). The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM) . My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years. In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....",

Because the darn thing is needlessly ENTIRELY GLASS, and virtually NO edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone. Cracks in the middle (mine was ONLY on the right \"infinity\" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so I could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed. The insurance company REFUSES to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 DAYS! I demanded Sprint make it right, but, as nice as Sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of D's. RUDE! They even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud. WTF!? So I left Sprint for T-Mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE. Second phone (first with TMobile) survived about a week and a half. It was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground IN A PROTECTIVE CASE! Looking at it right now. I knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so I've decided to just get a Samsung J7; basically a Note 4 without the stylus. Since I'm looking at my Note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, I'm glad to have a cheaper phone I don't mind so much breaking, and will eventually file a claim with TMobile, once I can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again. I love Samsung, but I HATE this phone! It's only brought me misery, and $1400 dollars down the toilet. Also, side note, no current phone repair places can fix this, because of the \"inifinity\" screen junk,",

                "review_text": "I believe this model is for Europe so it comes with 220 voltage cable charger. At least mine did. Therefore, you need 110v charging cable or wireless charger if you are considering this in US. But given this age, I'm sure people have lots of 110v chargers lying around. I simply put my AT&T SIM card from other phone and it works just fine It is Dual SIM slot so you can play it with either two SIM cards or one SIM and a SD card. Battery life is decent. I talk to other people quite a bit, occasional youtube and surfing internet on daily basis and battery lasts good for me. I had S7 edge with 3,600 mAh before and surprisingly, I feel both have similar battery life, so no complaining for me. I assume that software optimization works well as Samsung presents. But if battery life is still your main concern, then simply put battery saving mode, and you will be fine since there isn't much of performance loss from it. S pen is certainly a nice thing to play with. I can draw, write things on the phone. Personally, it helps me a lot for my new work environment. I don't use Bixby much but voice commands seem to work accurately. I don't have a big hand, but location of its button doesn't bother me that much. I don't use finger print unlock thingy at all so no comments on that. Iris scan feature works well too, if you are interested. But I use pattern unlock most of time. This supposedly great dual camera works fine. Quality of pictures are certainly nice and sharp. But because photography is my acutal/serious hobby, I use DSLR a lot. So this dual camera isn't that attractive to me. Don't get me wrong though, it will serve you great for sure. I bought this phone for S pen, not camera. As many of you know it by now, screen display of this phone is phenomenal. It's beautiful and sucks you right in. I don't know much about sound quality because I use bluetooth earbuds and android auto most of the time. Speaker of the phone itself sounds decent enough but for sure there are better phones for this matter. But it's not game changer for me. I can't compare its overall with equivalent products from Apple or any other brand for that matter, because I've used Samsung phones only since beginning of the time. (being Korean does that easily for you) To sum up, for people with experiences of Samsung products, If you want the cool, latest, flagship phone of the time even if S pen is for decoration only and wallet is thick enough, then it's for you. If you want cool, latest, flagship of the time and okay with spending quite sum but not this much and S pen isn't interesting, then S8/S8+ is for you. If you use/will use S pen extensively, and/or seeking upgrade from Note 4, 5 and 7(FE), then it's for you. (Don't forget trade-in deals) If you know that you want this specific phone for sure but don't want pay this much whatsoever and have a patience, then wait til next spring/summer when S9 comes out. (Not an official, but for sure there will be one) If you are okay with wife yelling at you for paying this much on a single phone, then it's for you (totally not personal experience, just saying) These are my personal opinion, yours will be vary.",

I loved my Note 3 and used it all the time for camera, web searches, MANY audio books, some note-taking and so on. Even used it for a phone! Now that I have the Note 8, the old Note 3 seems suddenly so old and slow and clunky. I studied reviews of ALL the \"flagship\" phones including the iPhone X (overpriced). I kept thinking I PROBABLY really wanted the S-pen (MUCH improved since Note 3) but still spent many, many hours looking at other options. Finally I decided I did want the pen feature and so Samsung's monopoly won the day. Nothing about the 8 disappoints. It is a fantastic phone and super smooth and fast and elegant and excellent, comparable to or surpassing similarly priced phones, in almost every way. The ONLY problem I have is the sealed in, non-removable battery. But nobody sells a removable battery anymore. Sigh. By the way I use the S-pen (like right now) all the time. It's uses and functionlity are awesome. All-in-all, Samsung has gotten pretty much everything right, I'd say. The amount of design and tech in this thing is utterly awesome.

I use my phone heavily for work and require high bandwidth speeds for presentations, collaboration and other internet hog programs and therefore this specific model phone will not work for me and thought I should let everyone know what I'm experiencing. You can kind of somewhat band-aid fix some of the above issues by rooting your phone and loading custom firmware and ROMs but if I did that I could no longer user it for my job and therefore the phone is useless to me... I love everything else about the phone including the gold color and am sad to have to send it back and go buy a dang AT&T branded one.",

The transition into this 18.5/9 ratio is quick after messing with settings, it made the phone even better from using gestures to get around and get the most out of the devics. This thing is fast and snappy, after changing a few settings and adding my fave launcher omg nothing can slow this down(for now). Theres only 2 things that im not entirely sold on. 1) on the back there is a DUOS branding(its not that bad but still takes away from the astetic. 2) this one is not entirely about the phone but more of the accessories it came with, since this is the international model it has a Europe charger but they did provide an adapter but it just makes the charger even more bulky.",

Brand new and sealed. To sum up, I am perfectly satisfied! The phone itself is a real beast! First of all, the build quality is excellent. It feels solid, premium and outstanding. It has a \"DUOS\" logo on the back, which, in my opinion, looks good. The large display is really awesome! Great colors, great quality, it is indeed the best display on the market right now. What is more, it is not uncomfortable at all, despite its size, I can quickly get used to it. The Note 8 is ultra fast and I highly doubt that anything can slow it down. This, in addition to the big screen, makes it perfect for multitasking. I was a bit concerned about the battery life, but after using the phone for a few days I can confirm that the battery is great as well. It can easily last me a whole day and I use the phone a lot. The fingerprint sensor is not as hard to reach as people report it to be, but I still find the facial recognition better. It is super fast, even in low light, and I love it. The camera is also amazing. It has tons of options you can play with, and moreover, the pro mode lets you set the settings manually, just like you can with a DSLR, which contributes to having even better pictures. I love the \"live focus\", it creates some great bokeh photos. Although the Note 8 doesn't have dual speakers, the audio is great too. It is really loud and satisfies my needs. The phone is packed with lots of features and I love every single one of them! Some examples are the edge screen, the off screen notes, the always on display, etc. The S Pen really comes handy all the time. Having it is definitely worth it and it makes the Note series stand out. I can't say much about Bixby since I haven't used it much yet. The package comes with a charger for the UK only. The phone says it originates from the UAE and what is more, its calendar has build in muslim holidays you cannot remove. But oh well, I quickly changed my calendar app and solved that problem. All in all, I am perfectly satisfied with everything! 5/5 stars for the seller and 5/5 for the Note 8!",

It actually has more cellular bands than US Phones. 5. Not filled with US Carrier bloatware apps 6. Yes LTE works just fine on AT&T and T-Mobile, Straight Talk....etc 7.

                "review_text": "I had held off buying this phone because of some reviews on the battery life. However, both ZDNet and Forbes reviewers said it was the best phone for business use compared to the IphoneX. My phone company gave me a 50% off deal and so I bought. Glad I did! The battery life has been great. I easily get through a 24 hour period with no more than 75% of the battery life used up. On light days I can get 48 hours of use before hitting the 25% left notice. Don't listen to those people saying they only get 4 hours. The only people getting that kind of result are doing a lot of streaming and game playing and there is no phone out there that will go more than 4 or 5 hours doing that. The Spen has become a good business tool for me and I'm now doing business on the phone I used to reserve for my desktop. One person I know bought one and he has now ditched his Ipad for the Note 8 when he is on the road. So far, best phone I've ever had.",

                "review_text": "While choosing dual sim clearly shows international version in the product title, the single sim version doesn't however I can confirm it is an international model. I purchased this sold and shipped by Amazon (not third party) and received a brand new model SM-N950F phone. Given how delicate the phone is, warranty is important to me. While I was informed it would be covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty even with it being an international model because I purchased it from an authorized USA dealer (sold and shipped by Amazon), I ended up returning it. Why? While Samsung support will say the phone will be covered under warranty, in practice you won't be able to get it service as the Samsung repair centers won't touch international model phones. Call the actual Samsung phone service centers and ask. It sort of makes sense since they won't have all the same parts the international models have. If you can live with the risk of no warranty and it not being serviceable in the USA by Samsung repair centers, it's a fine phone.",

I upgraded from the Note 5, because it was time. I enjoyed the Note 5. I never had any issues. The pictures were great, all videos worked properly, and I never got pop-up \"your phone is infected with 4 viruses\" while reading articles in Google Chrome. I was very pleased with the Note 5, so I couldn't wait to upgrade to the Note 8. I am having issues with the aforementioned. I would totally switch back to the Note 5 if I could. It was reliable. When I was videos, from YouTube to Twitch, the video either wants to minimize into its own window (with Twitch) or it tries to (with YouTube). Simply put, this phone is terrible.",

                "review_text": "Great, but Pricy We as consumers mostly like to have the latest and greatest, especially when it comes to electronics. Today I want to share why I choose the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. There are far too many unique features to talk about. Although it looks great, there are more factors that played a role in making the decision to own it. SOFTWARE Freshly re-branded Samsung Experience is a mature Android and its qualities set it apart from other Android phones. Samsung Experience is very customizable. From the home screen you can swipe up or down to open your app cabinet. The screen supports over 4000 pressure sensitivity points, meaning tiny adjustments in pressure will change how your scribbles appear. CAMERA The main camera is excellent, producing clear, detailed and colorful shots that are worthy. There loads of modes to choose from, and there\u2019s even a Pro mode for adjusting settings such as shutter speed to your exact liking. While retaining the overall same look and approximate same size as the Galaxy S8+, it features and upgraded processor, and, For the first time in Samsung\u2019s smartphone history, a dual-camera system in the rear of the device; one functions as a wide-angle lens and the other as the telephoto lens, with both featuring 12MP resolution and optical stabilization. PROCESSING POWER The Note 8 is powered by a Exynos 8895 or Snapdragon 835 processor, depending on geographic region, along with 6GB of RAM. In the US it is sold with 64GB of internal storage along with a microSD card support, which is another favorite feature. The handset features a fingerprint scanner next to the rear camera, and retains facial recognition and iris recognition, which is similar to the S8. S PEN The S Pen offers expanded software features for the creation of handwritten notes. I love and use this feature a lot. I can remove the S Pen and immediately start writing notes on the display, which works due to the screen\u2019s always-on capabilities. \u201cTranslate\u201d is another great feature I love. It recognizes punctuations, lets me highlight entire sentences, and supports 71 different languages. The only thing I had to justify was a price. Thanks to those \u201cdeals\u201d I did not have to dish out whole $950 at once. It was broken down to small monthly payment with no interest and I became an owner of Note 8. In conclusion, I love my phone, although I\u2019m still learning every day something new about it. The looks, the works, the camera and all the features it comes with.",
