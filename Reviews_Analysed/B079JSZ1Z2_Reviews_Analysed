good phone  20
We made the switch from iPhone to this  and I m so glad we did.
Also  in typical Android fashion  you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on.
Never thought I d leave apple but Samsung has a better product.
my text messages go to my old IPhone.
If that doesn t help  they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty .
In a few months if I regret it  I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.
Transferring files from my old device was a breeze.
Well iPhone was better than Samsung after changing management they lost their quality.
Same was not true ot iPhone products.
Androids in general are not that good as iphone  as they always are trying to bundle notifications.
10x better than iPhone X. I can not recommend the S9  or Samsung enough  iPhone is for kids and old people.
                 review header   Well iPhone was better than Samsung after changing management they lost their quality
The camera  although great when you re far away  has absolutely awful quality  much worse than my old iPhone  when you zoom in.
                 review text   I received the product just fine  but Verizon was unable to activate it  since it didn t even recognize the device.
                 review text   Excellent product.
I didn t have it delivered but it s an awesome device
After missing tens of important business calls and overall not being able to use the device due to its 45 minute battery life i am switching fully back to iPhone.
screen buttons  so it s interesting adapting to a completely smooth device.
                 review text   This is a great device

camera  17
I was so excited about this phone  but it has maybe a  marginally  better camera setup than the S8 .
If you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.
With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently.
The camera capability is so good that I don t need to take a separate camera with me any longer.
The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun.
It s disappointing that this  superior camera phone  comes without the video editing app like all the previous flagship models.
The camera is as great as they said it would be.
The glowing reviews of the camera might be accurate but my purchase wasn t guided by taking selfies.
The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix.
Snappy  UI is good  screen is gorgeous  camera is great  pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800  smartphone.
With all the cutting edge features  the great camera  and the sturdy build  this is as close to perfect as any phone I have ever owned.
The camera is awesome.
I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing  No Bixby  but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.
The camera is secondary to me.
Granted  the screen quality isn t quite as good  nor is the camera.
The camera  although great when you re far away  has absolutely awful quality  much worse than my old iPhone  when you zoom in.
It does everything you want it to  has a great camera  beautiful screen  and everything you ve come to expect from a Samsung flagship.
Performance is outstanding  camera is outstanding  design is outstanding  I have only had one problem so far  and it hasn t been very consistent.
I mean the camera is awesome.
Camera is awesome  and the headphones that come with the box are surprisingly decent.
I really like the big screen  and extra camera.
                 review header   The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix
The camera is as great as they said .
AMAZING camera with loads of different features.

screen protector  15
Battery lasts a long time  screen is amazing.
review text   Pros  Fast  Bright and vid screen  great screen to body ratio  phone has good weight  not too heavy  not too light  usb C  fast charging  wireless charging  micro SD card slot for expansion  stereo speakers Cons  Expensive  annoying Bixby button  can be turned off  O. K. not great  battery life
Perhaps it s that the screen is too sensitive.
                 review text   The large screen does not translate to a massive body .
                 review header   screen is amazing.
Listening to music  videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers.
It has a nice screen though  but I like the iPhone u2019s screen as much.
I know I can adjust it  but on the V20 everything s a bit larger at the same resolution  because the usable screen is larger.
review text   Had it for two weeks and really find it a really fine phone  I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I sometimes notice dead spots on the touch screen  and i find myself having tap more in some areas than in others.
Snappy  UI is good  screen is gorgeous  camera is great  pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800  smartphone.
Visually  the screen is fantastic.
                 review header   Screen is fragile and NOT covered by warranty.
                 review text   The screen is beautiful.
While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.
screen is phenomenal.
Limited notifications on locked screen  Shows two lines vs full screen   scroll on iphone.
Also  glass screen protector  as of today  don t cover the full screen.
slim  shiny  beautiful screen  fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet.
I ve had it only a few days  and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.
this fancy screen is fragile.
The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great.
Anyway  S9 notifications  No notifications on locked screen  I have to take it  unlock  swipe down  needs both hands  and then I ll see notifications.

stars review text  13
                 review text   OK  I looked at my old S6 and decided it was time for a new phone  the S9 has better security  a slot to expand memory  newer camera and a Bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app.

                 review text   I liked it graphic so good

bad phpone  -13
The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn t legible.
Definitely a better choice than the  1 000  new iPhone  for my budget.
so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device.
I think the new iPhone X does this too but again  I m coming from a 5s.
                 review text   This is my third Samsung Galaxy after switching from the original iPhone.
In a few months if I regret it  I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.
When it worked  it was slower than my iPhone 6 plus.
Works on the Verizon CDMA network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iPhone 7  on the same network.
                 review text   I would like to try the product for free because I always wanna one.
Unfortunately  I had to return the device next day.
Don t know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iPhone  .
Instead  they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device.
If your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3  year old device  absolutely worth the investment.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad battery  -5
                 review text   Just wanted to comment that the battery life is terrible.
other than that you get a  battery too low to use flash  message.
                 review text   Love it  only thing is  wish it had just a bit more battery life  other than that no problems at all  got it to work with BOOST mobile too.good battery life  9
Beautiful screen and decent battery life.
Fast  great battery  great camera.
What is the point of Bixby  Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking  I should give Bixby a try  .
review text   Pros  Fast  Bright and vid screen  great screen to body ratio  phone has good weight  not too heavy  not too light  usb C  fast charging  wireless charging  micro SD card slot for expansion  stereo speakers Cons  Expensive  annoying Bixby button  can be turned off  O. K. not great  battery life
Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now.
                 review text   Great Phone  picture quality is amazing  good battery
Battery life is pretty good so far as well.
                 review text   this is a great phone with excellent battery life great for people who are power users very fast i upgraded from a galaxy s7 edge to the galaxy s9 plus coral blue the s9 plus has edge screen and if you turn your phone over during a sound or notification it will stop the sound.

samsung  8
Classical Samsung.
                 review text   While I have had several Samsung devices in the past .
All in all  I am happy I went with the Samsung.
I am not disappointed with switching to Samsung  this phone has a much better display and camera than the iPhones do.
review text   So my review of this phone may be a bit different than others I have never heard of anyone else having the complaints I have with the most recent of the Samsung line up.
I use LG  Pixel and Iphone  saw it all  and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago.
was able to trade in an old phone and saved  200  It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now
My first samsung phone 20 years ago  flip phone  was complete rubbish.
My old Samsung came with SVoice which I prefer over Bixby for simplicity but it s slowly winning me over.
I ve been a loyal Samsung customer for years  and when I hold a phone for long term use I really keep it until something is worth purchasing.
Muzak  Am still a little confused on the various Samsung apps  esp Samsung Music which is so weird.
Samsung one of the best now in the market you can go ahead and buy one I think their design improved well and there is hopefully no battery faults.
I am with straight talk and this phone is an unlocked samsung so you have to buy a bring your own sim kit which is then bucks and change transfer was quick and easy.
If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps  I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone.
Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me.
                 review text   Has a Bluetooth connection issue with blue tiger headsets that Samsung is aware of but has yet to correct
--------------------------------------------------------
a long time  -7
Battery lasts a long time  screen is amazing.
Once the Note 9 comes out  I will be sure to compare that against the S9  but in the mean time  I will switch between this S9  and my Note 8 as my daily driver.
                 review header   Much to lean from a long time iPhone user
review text   Love this phone Its amazing Have been an iPhone fan and user for long long time .
review text   Everything was great except the wired headphones that come with the phone already stopped working after using them for the first time
I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time.
                 review text   Honestly this is one of the best smartphones I ve used in a long time.
Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.
                 review text   Probably the best phone I ve purchased in a long time.
--------------------------------------------------------
crazy option  6
Decided to try S9 due it s small size  the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad.
Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings .
Well  that seems like it  except that I don t have such option.
Second crazy option  Turn On screensaver when screen is off.
First crazy option  Edge screen Notifications.
--------------------------------------------------------

                 review text   Very easy to handle and it is much faster than my previous phone.
                 review text   Very nice upgrade from s7.
--------------------------------------------------------
features  4
The other features are buried somewhere in the camera and Samsung provides ZERO instructions on how to use them.
                 review text   This phone would have 5 stars if it weren t for Oreo killing valuable features.
Amazed at all the added features.
It provides several super powerful features to improve experience of daily usage.
Feels sturdy  something about slow motion  NFC  all the fancy features  you can read the other reviews and marketing jazz .
                 review header   Amazed at all the added features
It was easy to transfer all the data from my iPhone because of the easy set up features.
                 review text   I have upgraded from s8 plus and I really see an improvement in the performance   especially camera  AR emoji and face detection features are awesome.
--------------------------------------------------------
feature  4
This feature alone was worth upgrading as I m an avid amateur photographer with several nice DSLR cameras  but face it  I take far more photos with my phone simply because it s always with me.
While this is not a HUGE deal for me  it is a feature that while I don t use often  it would be a nice feature to have if I need it.
Really great feature  and editable .
I enjoy using the  swipe  feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand.
3rd UPDATE  April 15th  2018 I discovered a great feature today.
--------------------------------------------------------
apple  -3
Never thought I d leave apple but Samsung has a better product.
review text   I switch from Apple  6s  and I m really happy I did.
All my desktop computers at home are Apple  my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple.
I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.
You get a lot when comparing to prices from apple and this is just amazing.
                 review text   I am a die hard Apple person.
--------------------------------------------------------
bixby  -3
Yeah  sure  You first have to create a Samsung account  then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button.
My only issue is the new Bixby button  it s not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature.
First  the  Bixby  personal assistant is a train wreck.
Thanks  Samsung for discontinuing what I need and adding what I don t  like stupid bixby.
guess I m not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it.
Samaung s community has been clamoring for them to bring back individual text notifications and to free up the useless Bixby button  but Samsung developers won t listen.
Ask Bixby to Rap for you  it s hilarious.
I wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby.
I bought this unlocked so I wouldn t have the carrier bloatware  but Samsung puts on plenty of their own  and along with Bixby  you can t delete most of it  just disable it.
--------------------------------------------------------
android  3
                 review text   It is a best Android phone ever.
Also  in typical Android fashion  you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on.
My last Android was a Galaxy S5  which was an energy hog.
But after disabling Bixby and its button  it s pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I m concerned.
In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately  I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps   products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products.
--------------------------------------------------------
button  3
My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes.
Love it  Fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too.
But after disabling Bixby and its button  it s pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I m concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------
issue  -2
I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful  I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue.
I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that .
We had the same issue with the S8 and the S9.
--------------------------------------------------------
price  2
The Ram  expandable storage option of 400 GB s  and beautiful display    somewhat ok price the more advance the more expensive technology will be  places the phone already ahead of many phone companies.
It u2019s not worth the price  flagship or not.
After you pay  75  more and if you are paying the full price up front  you can get the AT T phone unlocked and then you will have these features.
Great price  actually the lowest and best price online.
Price was the same as buying direct from Samsung.

people  1
10x better than iPhone X. I can not recommend the S9  or Samsung enough  iPhone is for kids and old people.
I see some people are unhappy that carrier visual voicemail is unavailable from the play store for this unlocked phone  and the s8  but it IS possible to get it working.
AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone .
The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company.

review text   The Galaxy S9 is a great looking and working phone  but I challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.

                 review text   Its basically da same as the Galaxy s8
I wish I could find a NEW galaxy s5.
                 review header   Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9  but happy that I did so far
Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9  but happy that I did so far.
When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9  your phone is  840.
                 review text   this is a great phone with excellent battery life great for people who are power users very fast i upgraded from a galaxy s7 edge to the galaxy s9 plus coral blue the s9 plus has edge screen and if you turn your phone over during a sound or notification it will stop the sound.

Limited notifications on locked screen  Shows two lines vs full screen   scroll on iphone.

Anyway  S9 notifications  No notifications on locked screen  I have to take it  unlock  swipe down  needs both hands  and then I ll see notifications.

review text   great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened
--------------------------------------------------------
operating system  -1
I ve been playing with it since I got it out of the box  I m still getting used to the new operating system and layout.
--------------------------------------------------------
work  1
Well  that option doesn t work good.
--------------------------------------------------------
thing  1
review text   I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.
The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels  and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto.
THE BAD  The most important thing on the phone simply doesn t work right  network reception  I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3.
So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah.
I do love the creativity behind this and camera features  but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently.
--------------------------------------------------------
problem  1
Seems others are facing similar problems and it s likely a touchscreen problem  dead zones .
Even when I can convince Samsung support that Alaska is not a foreign nation they don u2019t seem to be able to tell me if the problem is intentional or fixable in the future.
Performance is outstanding  camera is outstanding  design is outstanding  I have only had one problem so far  and it hasn t been very consistent.
This is an Android problem  same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL.
The second problem is that  we are in 2018 and I still don t get it why Samsung still hasn t added the   Screen turns on by notification  feature yet when 99  of the phones today have this feature.
--------------------------------------------------------
settings  -1
Settings are multi layered and manual is useless  eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs  if you do not it is setup to eat battery power  and data at amazingly high rates.
Some settings available that don t help much.
--------------------------------------------------------
software  1
Had trouble with texting that I thought was due to software lag.
The only thing to envy from Iphone is the dynamic software navegation.
However  the software is better thought out and implemented and  as such  much more user oriented and modifiable.
