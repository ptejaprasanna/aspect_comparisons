good phone  9
I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.
My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438.
                 review header   If you don t want iPhone X but still want best iPhone then this is it.
                 review header   iPhone is not worth paying a fortune
                 review text   nice and awesome product.
                 review text   TechnoMaster sent me a great iPhone 8plus  new and crossed many thousands of international roads but got me the product unlike that dung pile KWIRELESS  heathens.
Else why apple declare waterproof iphone  but don u2019t give warranty if water will be revealed inside phone.
                 review text   I  upgraded  from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.
Unit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone.

bad phpone  -9
                 review text   The phone works perfectly  it did come unlocked  the only thing I was not satisfied with is that it didnt come with that thingy to open the sim compartment  I had to use one from other iphone.
Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.
All in all a rockstar product.
The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.
Other than the battery life  I believe the iPhone 8 Plus to be a top.
Guts are virtually same as iPhone X.

so my last iPhone was SE  I am an android user from this point on.
                 review text   I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it.

time  -4
I m a long time Apple fan boy but may have to switch when this one dies as I NEED the 3.
                 review text   Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus  but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack  You can t charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time  unless you use a wireless charging pad  which you can t use if you use those magnetic car phone holders  if you cover the spot .
They were always taking blurry pictures and had a painfully hard time focusing in on things.
Overall it preserves time  albeit milliseconds it u2019s time  nonetheless  and I find the thumb scanner to be tremendously useful.

bad battery  -3
Other than the battery life  I believe the iPhone 8 Plus to be a top.
New phone is slightly more responsive and battery life went from great to phenominal.
The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.
--------------------------------------------------------
camera  3
The camera is better than my 6Plus  so is the battery.
Perfect for those looking for a fast  good looking and with a good camera phone.
Every Android I u2019ve ever bought didn u2019t have the best camera.
--------------------------------------------------------
wide angle  -3
The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens.
I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16 9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget.
I will miss the wide angle lens.

true tone  2
The screen is brighter  the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen.
Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature.

android  2
My favorite Android device  which has gotten a lot of use  has been my phone  an LG G2  then G4  then G5 .
I mean sure  iPhones have better cameras and allow group chats  but could they be drastically better than my Android  Soon enough  I bought the iPhone 8 Plus and realized just how right my friends were.
--------------------------------------------------------
optical zoom  1
Even though optical zoom is only 2x  it is nice to have.
--------------------------------------------------------
voice dictation  1
I use voice dictation a lot on my Android.
--------------------------------------------------------
headphone jack  1
I wasn t too happy there was no headphone jack  but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter  which has a DAC in it  sounds better than my LG G5.
--------------------------------------------------------
portrait mode  -1
It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.
