review header screen  27
I do not watch youtube in full screen.
                 review header   Not compatible with Sprint.
I am not a fan of the curved edges  preferring the flat screen.
                 review header   But was happy with the purchase
from the pulldown notification menu not pulling down properly  to the extreme lack of screen touch sensitivity  im really wishing id have waited for the new iphone.
                 review header   I was nervous about buying the phone online and if .
                 review header   Very disappointed
                 review header   but it is beautiful  I love it
The screen is fantastic  great resolution and brightness.
                 review header   great
                 review header   bad phone
My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200.
                 review header   It is very good.
I definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen.
The bubble screen just makes finding a good  and sturdy screen protector on it difficult.
review text   I have a problem because the screen broke  I whant to know if the warranty cover that  because I did not buy screensaver because the screen was resistant to everything.
Don t waste your money on this phone  don t let Samsung think that it s ok to make people buy certain chargers just so they can get extra money from you or leave your screen vulnerable to damages so you have to buy insurance on it  or a new phone.
                 review header   great phone
                 review header   dual sim
                 review header   Several steps back
With the introduction and quick adoption popularity of HDR technology  they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.
                 review header   Is it real and what carriers it works with
The rest of the characteristics don t matter so much when the whole screen becomes a spider web every several weeks.
It has a beautiful screen that can display the phenomenal pictures this phone takes.
                 review header   Worked at first  then the speaker started acting up  then no signal.
                 review header   it looks good and I got what I expected to get
Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors.
                 review header   Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors
Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans  but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed  so it would be delayed for another year or two  they are still on track for 2020 .
                 review text   Lasted one day and the screen turned into green.
                 review header   performs great  amazing camera
So  I have a brand new phone with a wrecked screen and no way forward to get it fixed.
Edge screen is beautiful  but annoying in two situations.
The S8 has the most fragile screen of any smartphone EVER.
It is so convenient to use it to activate the screen.
The edge to edge screen is amazing  put it next to any phone out there and it stands out.
Samsung s 2017 version is so good  it is apparently the best screen ever.
yes  I knew this when I ordered it  but there s no other way to get all these features with a smaller screen.
The cuvre prevents you from accessing the time bar on some video player when in full screen  making rewinding or fast forwarding a hassle.
                 review text   The screen is really vulnerable so you really need to invest on good screen protector and case.
                 review header   and great
                 review header   Not so great.
really vulnerable so you really need to invest on good screen protector and case
Edge screen makes it impossible to hold and actually use  and most of all touchwiz though better and prettier than before still destroys the android experience with some time of use  making this very capable piece of hardware slow and clunky.
                 review header   good phone
Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix  on that gorgeous screen  u ll need to charge it twice  but on most days I didn t need to.
The phone will not power up  if you put magnet on the screen it sticks  if you put a magnet on real screen it will not stick because it is glass .
I had a screen protector and case on it and the screen shattered really bad when I dropped it.
Above are for S8  S. is similar  part number replaced 955 with 950  with smaller screen and battery power.
                 review header   Not Good
                 review text   I need to send back my phone the screen got broken how can i send it back
                 review header   I like because it is simple
                 review header   so far so good  I have always been a dedicated samsung galaxy .
                 review header   good quality
Finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works  and doesn t impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen  even otter box doesn t have on that works.
The screen is outstanding and cant say enough good things about this phone.

good phone  25
I also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues  but I am a working Father who doesn t have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective.
                 review text   this is a gift and the product is beautiful.
                 review text   excellent product
I am admitted to the maternity ward  delivery will be on Friday  but I will not be able to use the device  which was sent to technical assistance.
Was a bit disappoint but the device itself is breath takingly beautiful.
                 review text   The device is awesome
                 review text   Very good product thanks.
                 review text   I tried so many  flagship phones that past year trying to replace my S6 edge  From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10  until I found the Note 7  too bad it was recalled  went on the hunt again  or was it then that I got the XZ  anyway ended up with the Google Pixel  which though very good  still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note.
WTF  So I left Sprint for T. Mobile on principal and paid the remaing  700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE.
                 review header   Was a bit disappoint but the device itself is breath takingly beautiful
                 review text   Excellent product at a great price.
Brand new and good product
not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it s usable.
Bixby is the  siri  for this device and works great.
I haven t noticed any performance improvements when compared to my old iPhone 6.
An optical zoom would have been nice  like in Iphone 7  but not really an issue for me  see pro tip  6  UNIQUE ADVANTAGES 1.
My old iPhone had a good design  with the power button on top.
                 review text   excellent product  I received it in time
                 review text   Great product and arrived sooner than expected.
                 review header   I change my iphone for this  and I am so happy
Now with him having this delightful device I can hear everything  Never more excited to listen to the splash as his turd falls in the toilet
It is a fast and reliable product.
                 review text   Do like it better then Iphone 7plus.
                 review text   I ve been an iPhone user for many years and just switched from iPhone 6 to the Galaxy S8 and I love this phone  Definitely more fun than an iPhone and runs smooth and fast.

camera  17
I reseted setting factory but real camera still not clear.
Good camera.
The camera is good but shows photos ridiculously saturated.
Pro  Decent Camera  good with low light environment.
review text   Over priced phone not worth have price  nathing special battery sucks compared to huawei mate 9  colors not real  camera average.
As of today  it u2019s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs  Excellent rear camera  excellent front camera  reviewers too often ignore this  water proof  dust proof  wireless  fast  charging  full.
                 review text   Camera is just amazing.
It is a new camera system developed by Sony  and it is a dual.
                 review header   The camera is not good as a samsung
leading screen  excellent and reliable  rear AND front  camera  full.
The camera is not good as a samsung.
More like  you are buying a digital camera that also lets you speak on phone and chat on messengers.
The camera it s perfect it has a lot of settings.
The display and camera are nice  but that s not something lacking in most modern phones.
Battery life is good  and the display quality and camera are second to none.
                 review text   It is a wonderful phone  the camera is excellent.
                 review text   Really far and amazing camera  don t think bixby is going to last long but it s a cool feature
on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge.
It is without a doubt the best camera in a smart phone i ve ever seen to date.
                 review text   Awesome phone  LOVE IT  All features are great  Camera is sooo clean
The fingerprint scanner is oddly placed  it is not easy for me to use  it is slower than an iPhone X or iPhone 8  and I just discovered that it uses the same camera as last years s7  and It is very fragile  I have had the phone for less than 3 months and there is already a crack in it.
                 review text   Camera lose focus.
Phone is very fast and camera looks great .
                 review header   performs great  amazing camera
The front  selfie  camera is also vastly improved  but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.
Looks stunning  performs great  amazing camera  best screen on a smartphone hands down.
The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I m sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it.
                 review header   It is a wonderful phone  the camera is excellent
The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my  5000 camera i use for professional photography.
The camera  once near instaneous to turn on  now takes about a second.
Personally  the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide.
The camera is just great  While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone  I still think this S8 is a little better.

bad battery  -8
I ll provide a real life example of use.
                 review header   Poor battery life  expensive and hard to charge.
G955FD  International version  Duel Sim Card  Samsung Exynos Processor  supposedly use less battery  last longer    for GSM carriers SM.
I am frustrated with it daily and the battery life is terrible.
In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.
G955F  International version  Samsung Exynos Processor  supposedly use less battery  last longer    for GSM carriers SM.good battery life  16
Been a Samsung user my whole life.
Battery life is good  and the display quality and camera are second to none.
Great Battery life  3500 amh  last longer then any other phone I had in the past.
Battery life has been great so far lasting me through a full day easily but I do have to charge it every night.
                 review header   Poor battery life  expensive and hard to charge.
It s simple to operate  good battery time.
First off let me say how great the battery life is.
Good battery optimization .
review text   Over priced phone not worth have price  nathing special battery sucks compared to huawei mate 9  colors not real  camera average.
Great battery life 3.
After about a month of use  I bought a docking fast charger also to make my life a little easier  since I kept pulling messing up my charging cables.
Been a Samsung user my whole life
                 review text   Poor battery life  hard to charge.
The battery is OK but if you don t have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick.
                 review text   The battery is really very poor.

It is a fast and reliable product.
info though so genuine product.
from the pulldown notification menu not pulling down properly  to the extreme lack of screen touch sensitivity  im really wishing id have waited for the new iphone.
So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size  only bested by the  much smaller  iPhone 7  4.

I ve had a lot of phones over the years  starting with the original iPhone and averaging about a phone a year  and this is the first one that I immediately disliked  I do a lot of research before buying something that costs  600 .
The fingerprint scanner is oddly placed  it is not easy for me to use  it is slower than an iPhone X or iPhone 8  and I just discovered that it uses the same camera as last years s7  and It is very fragile  I have had the phone for less than 3 months and there is already a crack in it.

display  7
                 review text   The best phone I ve ever purchased  amazing display  great camera  the only problem  is that I got the UK version  meaning  my adapter was different than what I use in the U. S. so I had to buy a fast charging adapter separately
This is by far the best display I have ever seen on a phone  samsungs amoled display technology is at the top of its game.
Beautiful display  image  .
Customer Care said that it was not possible to change the display even though the pictures of the themes show it.
                 review text   I have the phone for more than a month now  it s a beautiful phone  the display looks great  I can copy my photos and music and whatever I want freely to the computer and back unlike on an iPhone.
If there was  the 18 9 display would be inconsequential  since you d effectively have a 16 9 display .

international version  -7
                 review text   I had recently paid for the unlocked international version of the Samsung Galaxy S8 SM.
This  international version  that I bought is actually for the United Arab Emirates.
I bought mine while being stationed in Italy and having the international version makes things sooo much easier when traveling for work and needing different SIM cards while in other countries.
G955U  US version  Snap Dragon Processor  supposedly better graphic support for gaming  I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers  but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.
review text   The S8 version I received had Panama firmware installed  some apps like Samsung Pay will not work until that country supports it  so if SPay is a selling point then don t get the international version  or get an international version with firmware from a country the supports SPay.
                 review text   Device its amazing  Everything is workin properly except I can make work Samsung Pay with it since its an unlocked version  besides that everything its amazing which I ll give it 10. review rating   5.
One TIP is that this come with a european plug  but all you have to do is go to the website and send an email explaing that you need an american attatchment and they will ship you one for free  I recieved two  This is what I sent them   Hello  I recently bought an international version of your unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8.
Samsung s 2017 version is so good  it is apparently the best screen ever.
                 review text   Product i received is defective continuously drops signal and is not registering to the network even though it is the international version and i am using in Jamaica  The bluetooth doesn t work either.
Excellent puctures  Be aware that this is the G. 950U1 unlocked version rather than G. 950F that some carriers are offering in LA.

a screen protector  5
Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors.
                 review header   Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors
really vulnerable so you really need to invest on good screen protector and case
I purchased a case and screen protector rhe same day.
The bubble screen just makes finding a good  and sturdy screen protector on it difficult.
I had a screen protector and case on it and the screen shattered really bad when I dropped it.
Finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works  and doesn t impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen  even otter box doesn t have on that works.
                 review text   The screen is really vulnerable so you really need to invest on good screen protector and case.

price  5
Either way it s a great phone especially if you can get it at a low price.
                 review text   Good price and shipping.
                 review text   Excellent product at a great price.
Sure its a lot of money  but you re paying a good price for something simply amazing.
I ll probably be getting a Sony Xperia XZ2 compact  god their naming sucks  whenever I can get one for a decent price.
I can t wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price  the s8 and s9 at least for a while.
                 review text   Note  I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality  and it s full suggested retail price of  750  and not based on price.
                 review header   Great phone and a fair price
                 review text   very nice phone for the great price.

years  -4
if you want a good hardware waterproof  dust proof android phone then you are better off getting last years galaxy s7 of waiting until october for the google pixel 2  etc
I think once we reach 6GB of RAM  any processor beyond the 835 8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.
The fingerprint scanner is oddly placed  it is not easy for me to use  it is slower than an iPhone X or iPhone 8  and I just discovered that it uses the same camera as last years s7  and It is very fragile  I have had the phone for less than 3 months and there is already a crack in it.
Never in the past eight years have I ever cracked a screen  and I cracked the s8 within a week.

review text samsung  4
                 review text   Definitely  the best Samsung phone
                 review header   the best Samsung phone
Overall  I think Samsung is starting to pull an Apple  where they re getting overly confident in their position in the mobile market and have turned to form over function.
If you don t mind the  750  price  you can t go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8.
Samsung phones have been slipping ever since the S3  which was the last Samsung product I enjoyed.
                 review text   Original Samsung  great phone.
                 review text   Nice phone but I stll love my old Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.
                 review text   interested in promoting this product and any samsung accessories.
                 review header   Samsung is terrible and has the worst  most unknowledgeable customer support ever.
A quick prologue  I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015  one gold  one white .
                 review text   Received a plastic model phone with second hand cords that were not official samsung.
Pretty fast Great camera Cons  Tends to lose WiFi connection where my Pixel XL does not Samsung is too pushy with adds from their apps.
review text   Beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old Samsung Galaxy Avant which is a great working phone  but it s been getting buggy in the last six months.
my phone does not sound good when calling other Samsung S8 phones or some other brands too.

                 review header   so far so good  I have always been a dedicated samsung galaxy .
                 review header   Another great Samsung Product
It is still on the warranty  but despite the fact that the product is registered Samsung is still not responding and the seller is silent  Sounds like a money waste for this price
D and this is the last Samsung Product I ever purchase on the rest of my life.
Very frustrated with that I called back and was told Samsung could not do anything  so I was stuck with a hand me down Iphone  but it is just a temporary phone  Right .

bixby  -4
I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U. S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice  They originally said it would be up and working in the spring and now they are delaying it again.
Bixby is useless to me.
                 review text   samsung software is awful and intrusive bixby sucks fingerprint scanner sucks headphones suck save yourself the trouble and get an LG
Bixby is useless but you can t disable it.
                 review text   Really far and amazing camera  don t think bixby is going to last long but it s a cool feature
My Biggest beef is with BIXBY  I m very disappointed that Bixby is only half baked.
Bixby is useless  and if you u2019re like me  most  u201cSmart u201d assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.
I am unable to disable Bixby  I do not like bixby.
All in all I really like this phone but if you haven t got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like  that is if that sort of thing is important to you.
the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used.
--------------------------------------------------------
direct line  3
Frustrated I hold my tongue and ask him for his direct line and email  he gives it to me and tells me to call him for any questions or updates and that the refund exchange dept should get back to him that day and he would let me know their response.
I swallow my anger  trying to be a sensible and caring man and begin this 2 hour process once more  and this ECA gives me her direct line and email after the process is finished and states she will email me with updates to ensure that I get it done in a timely manner.
I give her direct line a call 2 times in 1 day and leave a kind message just asking for an update.

android  3
Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back .
They display perfectly fine on other Android phones  but not on this  possibly due to the aspect ratio.
This is the perfect android phone ever made.
                 review text   Great Phone  Thin  light  awesome Android implementation.
This would be a great phone if you could delete all the Samsung apps and just run the basic Android apps.
                 review text   Very sleek design and a good android phone
I am happy to be back with Android after going iPhone for a year.
If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner  this isn t for you .

customer  -3
It began with my first couple customer calls  I followed all of their data reset regulations and yet the issues were still going on.
                 review header   Samsung is terrible and has the worst  most unknowledgeable customer support ever.
Call quality and reception are a ton better on the same carrier  so it wasn t the carrier s fault  as Samsung tried to tell me in several calls to their useless customer no.
                 review text   The phone is amazing  but when it stopped working  it become impossible to get the customer support to fix it.
--------------------------------------------------------
something  -3
I definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen.
I m so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason.
I definitely wanted to experience something small .
Samsung tried to make up for their last failure and just made something equally terrible.
Sure its a lot of money  but you re paying a good price for something simply amazing.
The side bar app thing they show as a selling point is also pointless  it s another stupid feature they add to make this phone  look  like they ve added something new from the older phones.
Really  the whole thing amounts to more of a novelty than something actually worthwhile.

I currently have the amazon moto g4 but missed samsung i had very first Galaxy captivate 8 years or so ago then had the 4 and wow the 8 is a huge let down .
Last one I had was a Galaxy S5 but the S8 makes the S5 poor in comparison.

quality  2
Build quality is outstanding  the phone looks and feels as good as it gets.
Camera quality is phenomenal.
I didn t know a phone could have such beautiful sound and graphics and great quality.
review text   Item was not sealed properly in box  arrived within the set time however there a 2 minor nicks scratches on the back of the unit  sure not entirely new unit or failed quality control hence price.
Camera quality is simply AMAZING as well  9.
Original quality with great features.
Call quality on the other had is hands down phenomenal  I ve made a lot of calls with this phone and have constantly been blown away with how crisp and clear the calls are.
The headphones are from a akg company which is not real samsung  the phone camera quality is terrible my old note 3 has better quality.
The display quality is great.
--------------------------------------------------------
service  2
I have wasted HOURS of time speaking to this company and their service is so poor I can safely say that Samsung will not be a brand in my life or my families life.
Its a GSM network phone im guessing its only for GSM Sim Cards i put my cricket sim card in   it accepted it fine its very fast and has great service   I recommend this phone    D
Took it to AT T who told me it was incompatible with their service too.
                 review text   Great product but customer service could be better.
I call yet again and jump through the hurdles and hoops  I am told that they are having issues with their computer system and that their accounting dept was closed the day before and that my refund is still pending  WHAT  I laugh yet again  because at this point I am just so shocked at how horrible this service is  and I am informed that I need to call again in 24 hours to see where it is at.
                 review header   Warranty is Joke  and customer service is non.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  2
It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in.
It blows away apple in my opinion  Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can t be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don t know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc s. It also installs some other apps you don t know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple.
But in reality it s just the same as having certain apps in a folder on your wallpaper.
--------------------------------------------------------
stars  -2
I give 4 stars because it s a little tough to get used to after using older models of Samsung phones.

Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors.
                 review header   Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors
Almost no loading time.
I also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues  but I am a working Father who doesn t have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective.
It adjusts to your needs and even tells you people who you frequently contact at a certain time.
mainly the beautiful curved screen design  but even more so  the awesome camera  which was the best for its time  and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light.
also I got it in certain time.
So  they stated I need to send the phone in and have it looked at and fixed before they could do anything else  which was totally fine with me the first time .
Holds a charge for a long time and charges quickly.
review text   so far so good  I have always been a dedicated samsung galaxy user for years  and I was afraid the invisible menu buttons would give me a hard time to adapt.
The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning  out of the box  my phone was at about 50  power.
You have to hold down the volume down button and the power button at the same time.
I dropped my S5 all the time and it was always fine.
I inform her that it is still having these issues  she then informed me that it still does not qualify for an exchange because there was not anything repaired the last time I sent it.
9GHz  Able to run at a higher frequency for more stable time.
I have wanted the S8 for a long time and just recently bought one  3 days ago in fact and I absolutely love it.
--------------------------------------------------------
glass  -2
Basically you ll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone.
                 review header   How to fix broken glass screen
                 review header   The most breakable glass on any phone
too much glass exposed on the edges.
the othere non glass ones have bubbles constanly have bubbles on it.
Of course  I have tried to be very careful  but due to the full glass body of the phone  it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily.
The most breakable glass on any phone

Simply took the sim card from my Galaxy s6 into the Galaxy s8 and I was good to go  Love my new phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
edge  2
So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge  or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand.
The edge idea is cool but it has draw backs  screen protectors don t work good on them and case don t protect edge  so screen is more susceptible to damage.

google pixel  -2
5 to speed things up  Google this if you don u2019t know what I mean  4.
What a piece of garbage  Samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than Google s but they enable it by default.
I committed the biggest mistake of my life when I decided to get rid of my Google Pixel XL phone.
                 review text   I tried so many  flagship phones that past year trying to replace my S6 edge  From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10  until I found the Note 7  too bad it was recalled  went on the hunt again  or was it then that I got the XZ  anyway ended up with the Google Pixel  which though very good  still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note.

thing  1
                 review text   Only bad thing is that some stuff I can t change from Italian.
                 review header   Beautiful thing but useless if you want a phone
The worse thing is my phone felt the first day one foot and it cracked bad.
This thing is slow.
And the most important thing  The International version Exynos 8890 or 8895 Only support GSM unlock  But US version Qualcomm 835 Unlock the entire network CDMA and GSM  Meaning that you can use this phone at any network company in the world.
It s just an ascetic thing and adds nothing to the phone.
I took a chance hoping they would be real after researching fake s8 s and about the company I can say they are the real thing.
the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used.
review text   Don t need me to tell you this thing is amazing.
Verizon cant open it  Beautiful thing but useless if you want a phone.
The worst thing about this phone  The fingerprint sensor.
Really  the whole thing amounts to more of a novelty than something actually worthwhile.
All in all I really like this phone but if you haven t got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like  that is if that sort of thing is important to you.
                 review text   It came with double sim tray  a very good plus  I bought it for the color and it was a good thing it had 2 sims.
