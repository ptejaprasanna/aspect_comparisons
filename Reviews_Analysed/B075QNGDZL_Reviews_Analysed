Battery life  The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus.
review text   Someone with five helpful reviews stated that the iPhone for sale here is fake using the evidence that the iPhone on the back say iPhone X  this is completely untrue if you go to the Apple site and look at the back of the phone it just says iPhone.
If I could go back I would make the same decision again  and purchase the iPhone X. I love my new iPhone
In addition  wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X  and 8 series phones.
the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic .
I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.
proof fingerprint sensors of previous iPhone models.
it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed  and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers .
less iPhone to be difficult  but all of the gestures feel so natural.
The data transfer from my old IPhone started as soon as I put them close to each other.
I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space  but do note  this is Apple s flagship and there are cheaper iPhone s out there.
The glass back makes it heavier then the iPhone 7 but I like that because it u2019s feels more premium to the hand.
Bottom line  if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free  AT T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line  then I would wait for the next generation.
This is new and only available on the iPhone X. .
but the handset is regular iPhone  6 7 8  sized .
                 review header   This is the worst iPhone I u2019ve had the miss fortune of having
                 review header   This will be my last iPhone
The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand.

                 review text   This is the worst iPhone I u2019ve had the miss fortune of having.
There was a great deal of anticipation for the iPhone X  because it was the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone.
Not new iPhone
It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size.
                 review header   Iphone not new
I will explain why the iPhone X was worth the wait and is a fantastic product for fellow phone shoppers  Specifications What was initially clear with my new iPhone was how sharp and vibrant the screen was.
term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype.
When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby  select yes  and you can wireless transfer all your apps  settings  backgrounds  passwords  etc.
I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6.
                 review text   The phone was quick to overheat during i cloud backups  most buggy iphone i ever had  screen dimensions and format are terrible  worse than any previous phones  curved edges and notch at top gove you less surface than th8 plus and in some cases maybe even thr 8  app developers yet to optimize apps  wasted space at bottom of phone and top as apps and even imessages dont use it.
I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.

good phone  31
                 review text   nice phone buy too expesive   its the same like the other iphones just with the different display
If I didn t buy the device in full  I would have been paying roughly  2  a day on a contract with Verizon.
This is new and only available on the iPhone X. .
The data transfer from my old IPhone started as soon as I put them close to each other.
My first iPhone X completely died from 40  battery charge.
                 review text   It is the best iphone I ve ever had  I ve had Iphone 5  5s  6  6S Plus  7 Plus This is by far the better  right size  nice presentation  fast  good new features.
The second iPhone X worked very well until tonight.
The point is  if you are like me  your phone is a utilitarian device.
When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby  select yes  and you can wireless transfer all your apps  settings  backgrounds  passwords  etc.
                 review text   Not a good iphone
                 review header   Not your old iphone
Is it the best iphone yet  Yes  I think so.
Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.
Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaing a larger screen size than the iPhone 7 8 Plus.
Overall I think it is worth the price mainly because it has the best iPhone camera  the Animoji u2019s are worth it  and because it u2019s unique people immediately will know it u2019s an iPhone X just from looking at the back of it.
it really is a premium device .
If I still had my iPhone 8  I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X. I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn t properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.
IMHO the best iPhone to date.
                 review text   Just got my iPhone X yesterday as an upgrade to a still fully functional iPhone 6 .
I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.

screen  8
8 u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple  .
review text   Great phone  however really not a strong screen as is made out.
Further  the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it.
                 review text   Screen great.
I will explain why the iPhone X was worth the wait and is a fantastic product for fellow phone shoppers  Specifications What was initially clear with my new iPhone was how sharp and vibrant the screen was.
A large screen on a much smaller phone than previously.
The iPhone X maximizes its size with the entire screen covering the surface area  achieved by scrapping the home button.
Is the screen better  Yes but so what  The 6  screen was fine and the differences  as a practical matter  are not important.
The back panel is made of tempered glass  as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating  but the marks from the hands are clearly visible.
This screen is longer then the one on the 7 plus but it is not as wide as that screen and I like that but many people do not  It feels better in my hand with the more narrow screen.
Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaing a larger screen size than the iPhone 7 8 Plus.
The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S.
The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven t seen one  check one out at a local store.
Screen   What can I say this screen is the best one to touch an iPhone yet  I lover the way everything just pops at you with this display .
The screen looks amazing.
ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real.

bad battery  -2
I ve been an Apple user my whole life  and this is the first time I ve been so disappointed by one of their products.
While researching the product I found that OLED uses energy more efficiently than LCD which is a contributing factor to the long battery life.good battery life  6
Battery life  The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus.
The battery life is great  the screen is dazzling  and I love the face ID.
I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests  Battery life is the best I u2019ve seen on a smartphone .
So I would it u2019s good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery.
Space Gray Sold by  Aimsky  LLC I love this phone  this is my first apple product  android fanboy my entire life google products only .
I am pleased with the battery life of the iPhone X  and on many occasions my phone has lasted more than a day before needing a recharge which phone shoppers could very well find as useful as I do.

apple  3
with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present  Android and iOS  offering left for dead.
review text   Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.
If I still had my iPhone 8  I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X. I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn t properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.
If you don u2019t like it go complain to apple  but don u2019t leave this company bad reviews just because you feel like it
So I would it u2019s good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery.
When the phone restarts in a dark room  I can cover the white Apple logo  and the black background is not visible  Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a  u201ctele u201d camera  actually it u2019s a Normal lens  the old one is a clear wide.

facial recognition  3
Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect.
ID  I would have fully embraced the new facial recognition.
If you don t think you ll be content switching to facial recognition  you won t be.
--------------------------------------------------------
features  -3
I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation u2019s phones.
The iPhone X is anything but pivotal  ground breaking  outside of dropping it  it will indeed break  or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone.
                 review text   It is the best iphone I ve ever had  I ve had Iphone 5  5s  6  6S Plus  7 Plus This is by far the better  right size  nice presentation  fast  good new features.

--------------------------------------------------------
upgrade  2
The phone itself is a huge upgrade from the iPhone 5s.
The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated.
Aesthetics are better but  again  not earth shattering and not worth a premium upgrade.
As such the iPhone X is really not a very impressive upgrade from the iPhone 6 .

no home button  2
The loss of the home button takes a little getting used to  but is actually pretty neat  just swipe up to get to the home screen.
In my world  I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology.
Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two.

In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the  Home  key.
I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications.

price  1
review text   There u2019s no reason to hate on a newly released phone that is the same price as buying it directly from Apple.
I believe the price is excessive.
                 review text   U think the price is high but what u get is worth every penny  The pictures are better than 35mm camera with zoom lens   ud83d ude00 ud83d udc8b ud83d udc4d ud83d udc4d ud83d udc4d
note  I have no doubt that as a business tactic  the high price is the right thing for Apple.
                 review text   You can u2019t come in and hate on this company for their price when that is actually the exact price that apple is selling the phone for.
By taking these cheap precautions  I have peace of mind that my iPhone will bring back more in value than the relatively steep price the iPhone X demands.
review text   I upgraded from the iPhone 6  to the X at full price through AT T. It took nearly 6 weeks to receive.
Overall I think it is worth the price mainly because it has the best iPhone camera  the Animoji u2019s are worth it  and because it u2019s unique people immediately will know it u2019s an iPhone X just from looking at the back of it.
have for most people  but it is clear that a lot of work goes into improving everything on the phones  and I think goes a ways to justify the admittedly high price for the X.

camera  1
The camera is better than most new phone cameras  4K  Face ID works great for me  the all glass design is fragile  but a good case can protect it from a fall.
You could purchase an even nicer camera for less.
                 review text   This is a great phone with an amazing camera.
This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji.
The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth  1300 for a better camera  I do not think so.
When the phone restarts in a dark room  I can cover the white Apple logo  and the black background is not visible  Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a  u201ctele u201d camera  actually it u2019s a Normal lens  the old one is a clear wide.
