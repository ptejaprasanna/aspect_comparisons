bad phpone  -29
review text   I returned my iphone x  I m upset that the screen size wasn t offered in the same frame as the iphone 8 plus.
It was nicely taped in an original iPhone box.
This is new and only available on the iPhone X. .
With the front and back of the iPhone X being glass  one drop will lead to a pricy fix  upwards of  700 .
Battery life  The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus.
Almost double the battery life of the previous iPhone 7.
When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby  select yes  and you can wireless transfer all your apps  settings  backgrounds  passwords  etc.
Having the iPhone X be waterproof has been a long.
Who knows  maybe this really is a platform for them to build something really great off of  time will tell but in about 8 months the next iPhone will come out and mine will become outdated yet again.
term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype.
In addition  wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X  and 8 series phones.
Following the patterns of innovation stated above  the new iPhone X carries a dual 12MP sensor array as well as improved aperture and wide angle lens that is supported by image stabilization.
                 review text   This is the worst iPhone I u2019ve had the miss fortune of having.
I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space  but do note  this is Apple s flagship and there are cheaper iPhone s out there.
That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back.
                 review text   My order was new iphone x but no i phone in the box   Just empty box
I always waited and go the  s  version of the new iPhone.
less iPhone to be difficult  but all of the gestures feel so natural.
I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.
I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.

good phone  21
I am a huge fan of apple and an avid iPhone user  however when it comes to value I just don u2019t think this phone was worth the  1400 I paid for it and the 12 hours wait in line.
This is new and only available on the iPhone X. .
That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back.
Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.
When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby  select yes  and you can wireless transfer all your apps  settings  backgrounds  passwords  etc.
                 review text   very satisfied I would buy again  all excellent
                 review text   nice and awesome product.
                 review text   It was good
                 review text   excellent product and great and fast services and fast response
Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaing a larger screen size than the iPhone 7 8 Plus.
On my old iPhone  a 6s  I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge  maybe 2 hours of heavy use.
My first impressions with the iPhone X are great despite to some annoying OS bugs and I would highly recommend the phone.
But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price  a few negative reviews  and to be honest  the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever.
I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.
                 review text   The best of the best  excellent screen  easy to use.
Its heavy and you can feel it Maybe thats the reasson that the x is the moat fragile iphone ever Not happy at all
I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.
worst product i ever saw when i got the phone it was damage badly and i paid for shipping and handly

screen  11
Further  the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it.
The screen looks amazing.
The full screen OLED display is killer and it u2019s a must experience.
The screen is as beautiful as all the people say.
The OLED screen is beautiful.
Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaing a larger screen size than the iPhone 7 8 Plus.
8 u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple  .
The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S.
But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price  a few negative reviews  and to be honest  the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever.
                 review text   The best of the best  excellent screen  easy to use.
The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven t seen one  check one out at a local store.
ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real.

everything  6
Switching through apps  opening the phone  accessing everything  it s all so easy.
                 review text   Came on time and it was perfect   box   cellphone  everything was perfect .
Would I buy it again  Probably not especially at the cost and extra  250 vs the 8  which doesn u2019t have the screen of the X but pretty much everything else.
                 review text   Everything is great

bad battery  -3
Do I regret it  Pros  Amazing display Exceptionally fast Beautiful design and form factor  bigger display but smaller form is very helpful  Videos are outstanding Camera is world class and photos amazing Wireless charging very helpful Cons  Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoying Battery life is ok  not great  but not on par with 8  Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require it Design is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that design Let me just say that despite it u2019s amazing display  I should have gone with the 8 .

                 review text   Great build quality  great screen  great battery life and the best feature is the Face ID  quick and realible  much better and fast than a fingerprint scanner.
Samsung  HTC  Pixel can all have better quality cameras or displays or better battery life but apple IOS is light years ahead of android.

camera  3
There are some features I love such as the great Camera  Face ID  the display and the waterproofing but I expected much more off of the AR capabilities and  u2018evolutionary technology u2019 that this phone was advertised to have.
Super fast and a really good camera
Do I regret it  Pros  Amazing display Exceptionally fast Beautiful design and form factor  bigger display but smaller form is very helpful  Videos are outstanding Camera is world class and photos amazing Wireless charging very helpful Cons  Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoying Battery life is ok  not great  but not on par with 8  Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require it Design is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that design Let me just say that despite it u2019s amazing display  I should have gone with the 8 .
This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji.
The camera is just as good  if not better than I expected it to be and I often find myself in a dilemma due to the incredible quality  I no longer need to carry around my professional DSLR camera.

He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible.
                 review text   Great build quality  great screen  great battery life and the best feature is the Face ID  quick and realible  much better and fast than a fingerprint scanner.
Samsung  HTC  Pixel can all have better quality cameras or displays or better battery life but apple IOS is light years ahead of android.
Though the glass is now better quality and more durable  a drop can lead to serious costs.

glass back  -2
However  a replacement screen will cost you  275  and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around  400.
                 review header   Irreplaceable fragile glass back unacceptable
Further  the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it.
                 review text   Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly chassis replacement to fix.

apple  1
                 review text   I want to start out by saying that I u2019m a binge Apple  u201cfanboy u201d and own more Apple products then an average consumer.
review text   Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.
The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer.

time  1
I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications.
Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I u2019ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect.
