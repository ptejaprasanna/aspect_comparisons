camera  27
Excellent camera  hi def video  great storage  more power  faster  more efficient   just tons of features.
The camera is the best especially when paring with my Samsung TV s. The music side is outstanding and don t for get the Note and the pen.
The camera is phenomenal on this phone and it has the ability to take photos that look as if they came out of a DSLR with quality blur  even without the live focus functionality turned on  it is so fast  I have the ability to have 2 different apps open at once and the S. Pen is great.
However the camera is so high up on the back of the phone that holding the device in a comfortable way means you cannot reach the reader unless your fingers are abnormally long.
Camera seems good so far  but again  it should be.
00  I could buy an S8 unlocked that is waterproof and has a better camera than most of the midrange phones on the market.
This means youll be smudging your camera every time you want to attempt to unlock your phone.
best camera .
Next the camera was better than I imagined it would be.
It has the best camera quality than any other phone could have.
The camera is outstanding and having the note 3   I see the improvements and it s definitely worth the money.
The dual camera with dual OIS  Optical Image Stabilization  takes amazing photos in low light and has so many cool filters and  also comes with its own photo editor pro.
Note8 camera is sluggish and is unable to take crisp shots in restaurant style lighting.
Still  the Note 8 has a larger  more gorgeous screen  much more capable S. pen  great speed  even multitasking  great dual camera with more features than I ll ever appreciate.
It s fast  gorgeous  and has a great camera.
Beautiful screen and camera is absolutely perfect.
Cons  1  Camera looks good for social media because of the brightness and and oversaturated colors but actually has very little detail when you zoom in compared to Iphone 7  and other Android flagships such as HTC U11.
Camera is more responsive and the added extra lens makes a nice difference.
The camera is super clear and can be quickly launched by double tapping the power button so that you won t miss capturing those special moments.
It may dont have the best camera but still the camera in this phone is amazing.
The camera is the best I ve ever seen on a phone.
It s the best camera on the Android and possibly even Apple market.
Camera is good  both front and back .
So many features  so slim and powerful  amazing camera  great sound and options to change the sound  SD card capable  as with rest of Samsungs  great battery life  alternative security features.
Beautiful screen and overall design  a stellar camera  great speed and performance hardware  expandable memory  waterproof  the S. pen  and on and on it goes.
this new device is also equipped with new dual lens 12MP camera which enhanced the photography experience to the next level.
In other words  the camera is very very disappointing.

bad battery  -19
Its fast and very responsive  the battery isn t bad  the screen is absolutely beautiful.
Battery life  I was a bit skeptical in the beginning because of the smaller battery size but somehow Samsung managed to make it last longer than phones with bigger batteries.
Here are my observations so far   u2022 Even when buying new batteries for my Note 4  the battery life just was getting suckier and suckier.
I had to have my iPhone 5 u2019s defective battery replaced under Apple u2019s own little iPhone 5 batterygate scandal that many people seem to have forgotten about.
The battery lasts longer than the iPhone X.
I had a note 5  my main problem with it was terrible battery life  after only a few months would barely hold a charge for half a day.
The Note8 is marginally bigger  has dual cameras  slightly weaker battery  50  more RAM  and the S Pen  which is far more useful than I had imagined .
The size is amazing and even though the battery is smaller It seems to drain slowly.
average battery life  wireless charging  and superb security features.
With that being said  my battery last throughout my work day w pretty heavy use.
Let down by its terrible battery.
Samsung had to default the screen resolution to 1080p although the phone is advertised as quad HD 1440p  inorder to have barely adequate battery life.
Battery dies slower.
I did see a negative battery comment which surprised me.
If battery life continues to hold up  would give 5 stars.
Starting out  this will kill battery life but over a month or so it will level out depending on your usage.
but with a weak battery I can t keep it on the highest settings to enjoy all the clarity it brings.
Cons   u2022Battery life is subpar compared to Moto Z Play  even with the Note 8 s  Mid  Battery Saver option enabled.
Battery life  pitiful  stylus.good battery life  24
removable battery.
Battery life is acceptable   I work a 10 hour shift in the mornings and when I come home in the evenings I m normally somewhere between 77.
The battery life is good but not great  overall performance in this phone is pretty good  I haven t had any problems so far.
Battery life is fine if you lower the resolution  when you know you will have a long day .
Battery is OK I guess.
And no  I don t buy the whole  we wanted to make a safer battery  crap.
Removable Battery  always a minus  but all phones have non.
These were issues like defective cameras  hardware  not software  requiring hardware replacement of the camera  cases coming apart  numerous faulty battery issues and other quirks.
Connects to my to my whole life effortlessly and best of all.
                 review header   The bad  Battery get depleted faster than my ex Iphone .
Battery life seems good.
Overall  I can deal with the battery life issue and a bad sounding speaker in order to have a flagship phone that can take good Pictures Videos.
Still amazed with the battery life of this phone  upgraded from the Note 4. poor battery life .
Battery life on the phone was slightly sacrificed by putting the S. Pen in  but the battery is fairly large and there is also battery saver mode.
The battery life is fairly decent as I can get about 4 hrs of screen on time.
I get great battery life from my Note and easily get two days of use out of a charge  even with it paired to my vehicle and smartwatch all day.
The battery life is great still.
I not only haven t had an issue with the battery draing quickly  but even if this is an issue for some users  I have to assume they re using battery intensive features a great deal.
It has made my life much easier.
Great battery life.
review text   The bad  Battery get depleted faster than my ex Iphone 7 plus.
I had a 6. plus that would shut down and display the empty battery icon with remaing battery levels in the 20.

good phone  21
review text   Was an avid iPhone user for a while  they have better accessibility that I m a .
Yeah yeah Apple makes a good product too  but I m tired of their BS.
With stellar performance  a sleek body  outstanding screen quality  fantastic camera and the ability to handle all my smartphone needs just as well or better than The iPhone  Samsung is giving me every reason to make this switch permanent.
You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market.
I don t have puny hands or muscles so its size and Weight don t affect me but I can see where it would be a problem for my toddlers  who won t be playing with this expensive device anyways.
Cheers  and I hope that Amazon CS updates the advertising on this page to reflect this glaring omission of an otherwise good product.
easily my favorite device I own right now.
                 review header   Another great product from Samsung.
review text   Really good product.
Just a great device.
I have had every single iPhone since they came out  except for this year.
However   1 000 is a stiff price of admission to pay to finally get the first truly uniquely different iPhone in three years.
It s not a perfect device but it definitely deserves 5 stars for the amount of functionality you get.
The security features on this device are spectacular .
Voice quality in phone calls yes we still talk on the device  is very good.
After all  this is a mobile device and some people actually use it outdoors and don t like cases.
If you have the device that is working perfectly fine  I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1.
Yes  the phone only comes with 64GB  but yes it is possible to put up to 256GB of memory in the device and be golden.
all problems that my wife doesn t have with her much older iPhone.
I pretty much always use my iPhone if I have to make a call.
--------------------------------------------------------
screen  20
So glad I didn t. Good sized workable screen  stunning photos  and instinctive features impressive responsiveness from OS.
best screen in the market .
Unless you work at a nail salon  or perhaps telecommute  It s not possible to keep the edge screen safe from damage.
u2022 Sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I would like  u2022 Bixby is a slow learner.
Featuring 6 GB of ram  there is nothing that I can throw at the phone to slow it down and you can dock it for full screen computing options.
I did not like the taller screen  it reformats youtube videos to a smaller size and leaves an inch of nonused screen on each side  something I feared since the shape changed to so longer .
The screen is great but I guess it should be on a  1 000 phone.
a more vid screen  a zippier processor  more than ample memory  above.
The curved screen is beautiful but makes it very difficult to protect in a case  which you are definitely going to need one.
522 ppi makes this AMOLED screen gorgeous.
This phone has made me so much more productive due to its highly usable functionality and I feel less reliant dependent on my phone as notifications are much more discrete with the use of an LED and the always on display to show what app has a notification  without being distracting like the iPhone lighting up the entire screen.
From the perfect keyboard to the hot swap battery to the snappy respone and sharp looking screen there was little to want except i can spell better that it could.
                 review text   Fantastic all around phone  I was coming from S8  so this was a minor upgrade but still love the bigger more flat screen and Samsung software has gotten much better compared to previous generations.
This phone is taller but narrower than the Note 3 and videos do not take up the entire screen.
This new screen has sharpest resolution Samsung has made with spectrum producing millions shades of colors.
                 review header   The screen is so fragile that it cracked after a 5 INCH FALL
Taking into account the black space on the ends and the narrower phone  I m pretty sure I m essentially watching videos on a smaller screen now.
You can pinch to zoom in and take up the whole screen but then you are cutting parts out.
Im not a big fan of the edges on the side of The screen because is really hard to find a screen protector that work properly on it  however i have to admit  it does looks cool.
Screen is beautiful in all conditions .
The screen is large  yet the phone frame isn t that big.
Its fast and very responsive  the battery isn t bad  the screen is absolutely beautiful.
After only 6 days of use it fell from my hand to the table  about 5 inches  and the screen cracked  part of the screen went green and stopped working.
Lastly  The screen  It s big it s beautiful it s amazing but there are a few apps I found that don t wanna work with it because the developers haven t updated them to fit within the screen size.
                 review text   Beautiful screen impressive camera  just an overall amazing phone  best  880 I ve ever spent
All in all  this is the best phone out on the market right now with hands down the best screen.
great screen.
Pros  Stylus Fast and responsive Screen Waterproof Cons  Speaker Battery life I ll update if any problems arise but I m glad I bought it as of now.
The screen is beautiful.
Upgraded from a note 3  definitely need an upgrade lol  we were both unsure about the curved screen but it is actually looks and feels very nice
                 review header   Screen is very fragile
Overall  if you want a speedy  large screen  good camera  S. pen stylus  and a premium looking design  I would recommend this phone if price isn t an issue.
Can open text messages from the front screen  with the Note 8 I wasn u2019t able to  Touch screen is better  more accurate and more sensitive to touch.
That infinity screen is not for everybody specially coming from regular screen   not a good screen protector made just yet  you do lose some image cause of the borders  it really does look like the Galaxy s8 plus  not too responsive at touch at times .
Battery lasts me all day and the screen is unreal
OMG  the battery capacity is even less than the S8 and Note 7 which has a much smaller screen.
The dimmest I could go on the iPhone and still have decent screen quality both indoors and outdoors  not in direct sunlight  was about 75 .
Everything else is as one would expect  better screen  better perfomance  better speed  better pics  some minor upgrade in software functions that beautify the user experience.
The screen is absolutely gorgeous.
The large screen is usable as the bezzles are almost non.
--------------------------------------------------------
note 8 s  19
This new Note phone as also received a very impressive IP68 rating for dust resistance and water resistance.
I do wish there were two speakers on the Note 8 but it is plenty loud enough with the one.
                 review header   I have to recharge every 24 hours whereas my Note 3 would last a good 48 hours when I first bought it The screen .
I have to recharge every 24 hours whereas my Note 3 would last a good 48 hours when I first bought it The screen ratio on the Samsung 8 is terrible.
removable batteries  so what are you gonna do  3  128GB  What 128GB model  Stories have been put out that the Note 8 would be available in 64GB and 128GB models.
All I know is for me I m happy with my Note .
The Note 5 had it perfect.
C charging port as well as the fact that I knew Samsung would do everything in their power to ensure this Note was perfect after the Note 7 debacle convinced me to give this phone a try.
                 review text   I upgraded from my Note 4  which I still really liked  to a beautiful new Note 8.
This phone is taller but narrower than the Note 3 and videos do not take up the entire screen.
                 review text   I got this on sale to replace my long in the tooth note 3.
pressing on a key helps you quickly insert punctuational characters  and it works similarly to my old Note 5 with one exception  the long.
The S pen is a nice tool if you do a lot of hand note taking but I find it easier to just type.
Why not just send us a check so that old not owners can put it towards a new note 8.
                 review header   The most irritating Note yet
Otherwise  the phone is fantastic  On a related funny note.
The speed of the Note is fantastic and I breeze through apps and tasks just as quickly and easily as I did on my iPhone  sometimes even faster.
This phone is not noticeably thinner than my Note 4. so they can t blame  saving space  as a reason not to return to removable batteries as people have been begging for ever since they took them away with the Note 5.
Hopefully Samsung makes a better note 9. review rating   2.
Still  the Note 8 has a larger  more gorgeous screen  much more capable S. pen  great speed  even multitasking  great dual camera with more features than I ll ever appreciate.
It doesn t even seem possible how smooth it is writing on the Note 8.
This phone does not add a lot of width over and above the older Note series  but is much taller.
overpriced and low quality  setting were very good on Note 4  poor on note 8  layout of phone awful  must accept features or phone will not work  support.
Significantly louder than my former phone  the Note 7  and yes I kept my Note 7  .
Previously  I owned the Note 2 and Note 4  Sprint  so I decided to go all in and buy the new Note 8.
The reason I ponied up for the overpriced note 8.
                 review text   Samsung galaxy note 8 is so Awesome.
The Note 8 is much faster and more fluid.
That worries my a little because the Note 8 s battery can t be swapped out like the Note 4.
I m good with the note 4 for now  thanks though samsung.
This has lived up to the hype  does everything a Galaxy Note ever did for me and better.
Before purchasing my expensive Note 8 I listened to media on my Note 3 daily  now I must connect a cable to the headphone jack if I want to listen to media through the car audio  My research of the problem revealed others with the same issue  Samsung s Support resolution is  upgrade the software firmware in the car  After spending a grand on a phone  the thought of spending more money on car software firmware updates raised my blood pressure.
For making calls  the Note 8 is no better than any past models.
which is almost exactly the same as every Note I have ever owned  anywhere from 90 to 100 min for them .
press time is notably longer on the Note 8 such that it s extremely annoying to use.
I thought the Galaxy Note 7 was incredible and was so disappointed when it was recalled.
While it does seem there are some improvements in the camera photo quality and performance with each upgrade  which is a big deal to me  Im already so happy with my note 4 that I m not ready to spend a grand on a new version which is pretty much the same phone.
A few of my thoughts migrating from a Note 4  which I though was pretty fantastic .
The camera on the Note 8 is the best I u2019ve ever had on a smartphone.
I went from iphone to this Note 8 and am so far quite disappointed.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad phpone  -14
This phone is a technological marvel and is still cheaper than the iPhone X.
I did keep my NOTE 3 my IR blaster does come in handy I restored my Note 3 and was pleasantly surprised it s still a very fast device.
It s very thin and light and adds a ton of grip to this rediculously slippery device.
I had to have my iPhone 5 u2019s defective battery replaced under Apple u2019s own little iPhone 5 batterygate scandal that many people seem to have forgotten about.
3  Unless you manually change the resolution from 1080p to the advertised 1440p  the screen is not even as sharp as the Iphone 7  and much worst than other Android flagships running at 1440p.
Even after formatting the phone from the bootloader it would not let me set it up as a new device without my old credentials.
It is easily muffled and admittingly not as loud as the iPhone 8 Plus speakers.
                 review text   As a previous iPhone user  my friends raved about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.
The dimmest I could go on the iPhone and still have decent screen quality both indoors and outdoors  not in direct sunlight  was about 75 .
review text   Update  After a couple of months with the device I am more thrilled to have switched than I was before.
I switched to Goolge on my iPhone last year after iCloud u2019s calendar failed to sync several very important reminders across all my devices and failed to alert me as instructed.
this new device is also equipped with new dual lens 12MP camera which enhanced the photography experience to the next level.
Neither does Apple s new iPhone X. I like the fact that Samsung is pushing the envelope and staying years ahead of Apple in innovation incorporation in this flagship product line.
While I did not have any trouble with the actual phone I will think long and hard before I buy another device from a company that is not the manufacture.
--------------------------------------------------------
quality  13
With stellar performance  a sleek body  outstanding screen quality  fantastic camera and the ability to handle all my smartphone needs just as well or better than The iPhone  Samsung is giving me every reason to make this switch permanent.
I was tiring of Apple u2019s deteriorating quality and angry at the fact that they weren u2019t really innovating enough to justify yearly upgrades.
It seriously feels like writing on paper with a high quality ink pen.
Build quality is excellent  but I still despise glass on the back of a phone.
                 review header   I had a 12mp camera and the quality was good  then I got a Samsung S4 ZOom with .

I had a 12mp camera and the quality was good  then I got a Samsung S4 ZOom with 16 mp and 10 x zoom.
proprietary and poor quality  price.
The build quality is awesome.
The single speaker is very loud and clear as is the call quality.
The build quality is excellent and I m not restricted to just Samsung products to get the most out of my device.
Call quality is pretty good.
both because of the hardware and  better yet  the Samsung apps quality is actually good now.
VERY GOOD QUALITY.
Speaker and sound quality is good.
Camera speed and image quality are very good for a cell phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
time  -10
I m both frustrated and unhappy each time I drive now.
the sheer joy and exhilaration I get from having and using this phone  It s an experience I ve never had with another phone  the Note 4 came very close  but I had to cease using it  since it was carrier locked to Sprint  the most overpriced carrier and worst customer service in the world  even to long time customers since 1997  to December 2015 .
ordered the Moto z2 force and had it for about 6 months and then screen peeled off plus it was glitch the whole time.
The phone is absolutely amazing  However  when the SD card  which Samsung conveniently delayed the shipping by 3 weeks from when the phone arrived  is inserted into the phone  everything was ordered at the same time .
Here are a few things I ve learned over my short time with the phone  .
Hopefully it will last me a long time because I don t plan on going back to Samsung anymore.
Next time  if I bought a phone  I will buy small size not big size like that because I can not put it on my purse like iphone  and because it is big so my hand is so tired when use it.
two windows open at the same time   Side bar is good not great .
                 review text   I am a long time iPhone user.
They have not brought a single new and innovative feature in a long time and I think I will stay Samsung Android for now.
Will not work at present time .
The first time I have ever truly felt I didn t need my laptop.
Until next time  Apple.

                 review text   I have to give this a thumbs down just for one big corporate insult to the consumer that is all about making money over the consumer experience  which corporate calls  Bixby  a voice servant far inferior to google voice services  which come free on every android phone  that got a dedicated button  inconveniently placed  so that frequently when you pick up the phone the consumer will inadvertently hit the button and will be asked  for the 100th  200th or 300th time   do you want to set up Bixby  And there is no way to disable the button.

tons of features  -6
So glad I didn t. Good sized workable screen  stunning photos  and instinctive features impressive responsiveness from OS.
Excellent camera  hi def video  great storage  more power  faster  more efficient   just tons of features.
Star number 2 is for the forced features.
It is a great phone except that I discovered that important features are blocked by Verizon including visual voicemail and HD Voice.
including the iPhone 6  7  X  and the Pixel and Pixel 2 XL  I ve still got tons to learn about all the new features  and although I clearly did not NEED a phone at all  this phone did give me the one thing I have been missing since my first smartphone in 2012 .
Whereas the 8 Plus was lacking so many common features found in many of the top end phones today  I feel the Note 8 has gotten me back up to date with the latest tech available for smart devices.
HD Voice is also disabled and there may be other features disabled that I have not discovered yet.
Launching models lacking features  taking away features telling people you don t need them  then adding features other brands already have and acting like they were the first to the party.
So if you want convenient visual voicemail and features such as HDVoice  it is a mistake to buy an unlocked phone at this time.
                 review text   Absolutely amazing Smartphone with many many amazing Features.
Although it doesn u2019t capture the video at 1080p but 720p is fairly decent Now We know the specs  the new features of SPen   the all new Dual lens cameras of the Note 8 but should you buy it or not  Fact is the note 8 has pretty much the same DNA as the S8  same processor  a screen which has almost the same brightness  its just 0.
                 review text   There s no denying that this is a quality handset with a ton of great features.
this camera has latest features like dark imaging enhancer  dual background imaging which takes up to 23  more image than you need with extended wide angle imaging.
There s a great number of features that I don t even use  but I m sure are great.
Amazing features .
I m still learning new features with it.
                 review text   I would give it one star for the sheer amount of disappointment I have about this phone  but other features on it made me give it two.
Not many new features compared to note7 s pen but it feels smoother and more responsive imo.
But if you own a business or have kids  its worth the extra money to have the best features.
                 review text   Awesome phone with a lot of creative features.
Also  coming from an iPhone  I was not a fan of the screen size but it quickly grew on me and I have found it to be one of the nicest features on the Note 8.
The other features are quite nice and so is the screen don t get me wrong.
Having bluetooth on drains the battery quickly compared to all other features and settings minus maybe display brightness.
along with its great features.
I already had mobile pay and most other features on the 2.
                 review text   Good features  but all the adhesive makes it almost impossible to open the phone to replace the battery when the battery life starts to go.
I m still learning the new features  and especially like a few such as being able to swipe up for apps vs hitting app key  always on display and the many places to hide groups of your favorite apps.
So many features  so slim and powerful  amazing camera  great sound and options to change the sound  SD card capable  as with rest of Samsungs  great battery life  alternative security features.
this is a quality handset with a ton of great features.

visual voicemail  -6
It is a great phone except that I discovered that important features are blocked by Verizon including visual voicemail and HD Voice.
So if you want convenient visual voicemail and features such as HDVoice  it is a mistake to buy an unlocked phone at this time.
Better visual voicemail.
Also  I use google voice for voicemail only  this is what I use for visual voicemail  I have used this for years and it works pretty good .
Visual voicemail is a critical feature  it allows you to see a list of your voicemail and play them at your convenience  no need to dial into Verizon basic voicemail and listen to the massively annoying and slow process of hearing your voicemail read back by a robot.
Verizon prevents you from installing their visual voicemail app  the free and the paid versions  on any unlocked phone.
                 review text   The unlocked version doesn t have visual voicemail.
We simply cannot get visual voicemail or HDVoice in these unlocked phones.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  5
Lastly  The screen  It s big it s beautiful it s amazing but there are a few apps I found that don t wanna work with it because the developers haven t updated them to fit within the screen size.
Secure Folders is a welcomed addition to the security lineup and is useful for putting certain apps or folders under lock and key.
The camera is phenomenal on this phone and it has the ability to take photos that look as if they came out of a DSLR with quality blur  even without the live focus functionality turned on  it is so fast  I have the ability to have 2 different apps open at once and the S. Pen is great.
I m still learning the new features  and especially like a few such as being able to swipe up for apps vs hitting app key  always on display and the many places to hide groups of your favorite apps.
I love the two different about with certain apps
No one wants to use your email  browser and other crapware when there are superior apps are available.
One fun thing we could do with SPen is the live message  so draw down your short message and yes it can be sent via all your favorite sharing apps as long as they support GIF u2019s.
I ve tried about everything  including factory reseting it again and not downloading any other apps to see if that worked.
Like better   easier backup restore options  more freedom with settings and customization if you want to utilize them  an easy top notch optimization tool and ways to integrate old apps in a way that will utilize everything this phone can offer.
I adore the speech to text feature in WhatsApp and other apps.
I do not know of any carrier that allows visual voice mail or 3rd party apps such as Google Voice to work with these unlocked phones.

things  4
Heres why  First of all  let me start with some good things.
probably bad things would happen if you pushed it in the wrong hole too far.
Bixby does a ton of things like takes screenshots  creates new contacts  opens any specific Pandora station  opens Google maps and navigates to any address you ask for  gets you an Uber and many other things.
I love and HATE this phone u2026At  1 000 even diehard Samsung Android like myself starts to question MANY things u2026 1.
Some of it is true  but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don t discuss on their channel.
I suggest artists look into the note 5  they are beautiful things.
task  and do several important things on my phone.
Some of my personal favorite things about the phone  even after using it for the last 2 months  the S. Pen.
If only it didn u2019t constantly crash IG and have to be restarted  refuse to give me access to recent pics unless restarted  have the smallest keyboard with the send button right next to the delete button so I keep sending customers half written messages  and the worst auto correct program I u2019ve ever encountered  I might have more good things to say.
I can t list all the great things but I can give you an idea.
There could be things above that might be able to have been fixed  like removing advertisements from the Samsung  but I am sharing my experience since I was unable to easily take care of the issues above.
There is just so many good things to say about it.
I like to take macro shots of flowers  insects and lots of other things and all I can say is woww.

samsung note  -4
Although phones continue to get more expensive  Samsung manages to have great sales on their phones.
                 review text   The best Samsung smartphone I have ever used
This phone and the other Samsung devices I own make me feel like I live in the future.
I think these will be our last Samsung phones since Samsung doesn u2019t stand by their product.
I have to recharge every 24 hours whereas my Note 3 would last a good 48 hours when I first bought it The screen ratio on the Samsung 8 is terrible.
Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android.
So  I call Samsung technical support.
                 review text   I loved my old Samsung Note 4 until the screen broke and would have cost more to fix than the phone was worth.
C charging port as well as the fact that I knew Samsung would do everything in their power to ensure this Note was perfect after the Note 7 debacle convinced me to give this phone a try.
If this Bluetooth media audio connection issue is not fixed in an update soon I will be even more disappointed and have to admit I made an expensive mistake by investing in this premium Samsung smartphone.
like any other Samsung smartphone this device is also loaded with features useful for all types of people like students  business personnel and even for those at home at everyday use.
                 review text   This phone is just amazing  Comes quickly and definitely is the best Samsung smartphone
i don t think i will ever downgrade to a lesser samsung model.
Samsung was smart enough to keep the headphone jack and I assume the SD card is here to stay.
Including iPhone  Blackberry  LG  and other Samsung.
She said that is common with Samsung Unlocked phones.
Alerts and Notifications are different than my previous Samsung phones.
Hopefully Samsung makes a better note 9. review rating   2.
That said  Google  Nexus and Pixel  and Apple already patched their respective devices  but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack.
And it s pretty annoying that Samsung saw fit to put in a dedicated button for it.
Fortunately it s easy to turn off and Samsung makes sure to present options to use another assistant if you d like.
Call useless Samsung customer tech service who blamed carrier  Verizon.
This will be my last Samsung ever.
                 review text   Samsung galaxy note 8 is so Awesome.
Before purchasing my expensive Note 8 I listened to media on my Note 3 daily  now I must connect a cable to the headphone jack if I want to listen to media through the car audio  My research of the problem revealed others with the same issue  Samsung s Support resolution is  upgrade the software firmware in the car  After spending a grand on a phone  the thought of spending more money on car software firmware updates raised my blood pressure.
It will take me time to understand all future due I never use Samsung before  so far easy to me.
Samsung has several preinstalled apps on the device that are in fact quite useful  but if you don t want them  uninstall them and that s it.
Now  Samsung was not perfect either.
Best phone that s out anywhere ty samsung
If the issue is not resolved it will likely be the last Samsung phone I purchase.
I m good with the note 4 for now  thanks though samsung.
These are the advantages iPhone   Samsung have over the other.

edge  4
review text   i have the verizon version and absolutely love it better the my previous s8 plus and s6 edge plus.
The rounded edge makes the phone difficult to hold onto compared to flat sided phones.
Unless you work at a nail salon  or perhaps telecommute  It s not possible to keep the edge screen safe from damage.
My favorite thing over the Note 5 is the beautiful edge to edge display and how bright and legible it is in direct sunlight.
u2022 The screen size is big and beautiful  essentially going edge to edge.
Maybe I ll reconsider if they get rid of the gimmicky edge screen.
The screen sensitivity just dropped to almost nothing even when there was not an air pocket and the protector had full contact with the screen minus the left and right edge.
The fragile rounded edge of the fancy but useless  edge screen  hit a speaker stand on the floor and shattered.

note 8 a  3
That worries my a little because the Note 8 s battery can t be swapped out like the Note 4.
For making calls  the Note 8 is no better than any past models.
This new Note phone as also received a very impressive IP68 rating for dust resistance and water resistance.
                 review text   I upgraded from my Note 4  which I still really liked  to a beautiful new Note 8.
Before purchasing my expensive Note 8 I listened to media on my Note 3 daily  now I must connect a cable to the headphone jack if I want to listen to media through the car audio  My research of the problem revealed others with the same issue  Samsung s Support resolution is  upgrade the software firmware in the car  After spending a grand on a phone  the thought of spending more money on car software firmware updates raised my blood pressure.
I do wish there were two speakers on the Note 8 but it is plenty loud enough with the one.
Previously  I owned the Note 2 and Note 4  Sprint  so I decided to go all in and buy the new Note 8.
overpriced and low quality  setting were very good on Note 4  poor on note 8  layout of phone awful  must accept features or phone will not work  support.
press time is notably longer on the Note 8 such that it s extremely annoying to use.
Still  the Note 8 has a larger  more gorgeous screen  much more capable S. pen  great speed  even multitasking  great dual camera with more features than I ll ever appreciate.

The reason I ponied up for the overpriced note 8.
The Note 8 is much faster and more fluid.
removable batteries  so what are you gonna do  3  128GB  What 128GB model  Stories have been put out that the Note 8 would be available in 64GB and 128GB models.
                 review text   Samsung galaxy note 8 is so Awesome.
Why not just send us a check so that old not owners can put it towards a new note 8.
The camera on the Note 8 is the best I u2019ve ever had on a smartphone.
I went from iphone to this Note 8 and am so far quite disappointed.

samsung galaxy  -3
removable batteries now   u2022 If you have small hands or have pants with small pockets  get a regular Galaxy S8 instead.
screen clock where the fingerprint sensor is active  and can unlock the phone  means it feels quicker to unlock than my old Galaxy Note 5.
It was hard for me to choose between the Galaxy S8  and Note8.
I have had the original galaxy s phone  a couple S3s  an S4  a couple S5s  a Note edge  a note 7  and now a note 8.
So I went to t mobile and bought the galaxy note 8.
If you have the device that is working perfectly fine  I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1.

This phone is not noticeably thinner than my Note 4. so they can t blame  saving space  as a reason not to return to removable batteries as people have been begging for ever since they took them away with the Note 5.

Great phone for a great price.
                 review text   I bought this because it was unlocked and a good price.
However   1 000 is a stiff price of admission to pay to finally get the first truly uniquely different iPhone in three years.
                 review header   Great phone for a great price
review text   Ugh  Wish I would ve waited a little longer  Well worth the 1000 original price tag.
Happy to find a nice seller at a great price.
I bought this phone unlocked on Amazon through Amazon and paid a premium price for it  I should get premium service along with that.
With all the available discounts on Verizon  the phone is approximately half price and for me a great upgrade
All these high tech innovative features and specifications like powerful snapdragon 835 processor with 6 GB RAM and options for micro SD card installation comes with a hefty price of  950 which is a lot to ask for.

Meanwhile Samsung customer service proves to be useless and consider this as a damaged screen rather than accepting the fact that it is a defect.
the sheer joy and exhilaration I get from having and using this phone  It s an experience I ve never had with another phone  the Note 4 came very close  but I had to cease using it  since it was carrier locked to Sprint  the most overpriced carrier and worst customer service in the world  even to long time customers since 1997  to December 2015 .

low light  -3
The camera works well in low light.
The dual camera with dual OIS  Optical Image Stabilization  takes amazing photos in low light and has so many cool filters and  also comes with its own photo editor pro.
Lastly the Note8 pictures in the low light seem slightly color desaturated compared to the Pixel XL.

thing  3
and when I tell you the camera on this thing is AMAZING I am not kidding  a picture so clear you can zoom in and count the fibers in someone s shirt  The phone is absolutely amazing and she is happier than words can say and I have no regrets.
So you have 3 or 4 apps that does the same thing.
However  my favorite thing to do is going into the PENUP app and doing some coloring.
Next thing that is amazing to use is the new Gear VR.
They should do the right thing and send me a new one  Anyway  rant over.
What about the  gorilla glass  What kind of  gorilla glass  can t resist to a 5 inch fall  Samsung has charged me 430 dollars  in Brazil  to Fix the damn thing.
The last thing I ll talk about is how powerful this phone is.
My favorite thing over the Note 5 is the beautiful edge to edge display and how bright and legible it is in direct sunlight.
Good thing is you can use both Bixby and Google assistant simultaneously  Also contrary to a lot of videos I m watched  I ve not yet once accidentally pushed the Bixby button while trying to push the volume buttons  .
The first thing that caught my attention was the dual cameras  12mpx2 .
One fun thing we could do with SPen is the live message  so draw down your short message and yes it can be sent via all your favorite sharing apps as long as they support GIF u2019s.
                 review header   The price was the most important thing.
The settings and options in this phone seem bottomless and I could spend weeks learning everything this thing is capable of.

galaxy note  3
This has lived up to the hype  does everything a Galaxy Note ever did for me and better.
screen clock where the fingerprint sensor is active  and can unlock the phone  means it feels quicker to unlock than my old Galaxy Note 5.
It was hard for me to choose between the Galaxy S8  and Note8.
I thought the Galaxy Note 7 was incredible and was so disappointed when it was recalled.
I have had the original galaxy s phone  a couple S3s  an S4  a couple S5s  a Note edge  a note 7  and now a note 8.
So I went to t mobile and bought the galaxy note 8.

software  3
Software is feature packed and I m talking useful features  not gimmicks .
If you have Verizon and the added software is not a bother you might find the phone working fine.
The added software start to download updates and keeps asking for setups for carrier specific features.
                 review header   If you have Verizon and the added software is not a bother you might find the phone working fine.
Software  other the afore mentioned  Samsung got everything right.
One reason for this is the sensible software management that lets you snooze hibernate apps that you don t use often.
--------------------------------------------------------
apple  2
It feels a little weird as an almost exclusive Apple user to own an Android phone.
Suddenly  instead of admiring how iOS always just worked  I found myself seriously questioning if Apple did enough pre.
I was so convinced that Apple was the pinnacle of innovation until as of recent.
On the flipside  Android Auto is much better than Apple Car Play in my opinion  especially the ability to use either Google Navigation or Waze in your car u2019s navigation screen  both of which blow the doors off Apple Maps  especially the latter.
That was all before Apple tried to get cute.
Now  in some programs it seems fine  but it s never been as good as Apple.
--------------------------------------------------------
feature  2
dim feature on either phone because it never sets the screen to a brightness that I prefer when indoors.
If that is a considerably important feature  I give the nod to Apple.
One particular feature that keep me using bixby is the ability to hold the Bixby button and use your voice to type in a text field   samsung keyboard must be open to work .
Camera takes awesome photos and HD video  although I have not tried the dual lens feature yet.
I am amazed that reviewers never mention screen brightness  but for me it is a very important top 3 feature because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and it is very annoying searching for shade or trying to cup my hand over the screen just to barely read it.
Samsung Pay is also a great feature because it doesn t rely on NFC and doesn t use your original card numbers.
I m shocked that such a basic feature does not work  especially with the flagship product of Samsung.
They have not brought a single new and innovative feature in a long time and I think I will stay Samsung Android for now.
there is also a new feature this time around which allows you to write on screen with your phone locked to make quick notes.
--------------------------------------------------------
stylus  -2
Second  the S. Pen stylus is far too sensitive  making it extremely difficult to write legibly or make accurate drawings  for example  unfortunately  the stylus sensitivity is NOT adjustable  which is a huge miss  in my opinion.
there are endless activities a person can perform with the new stylus making the phone more practical than ever.
Its a fun phone and has a smart stylus.
I have big hands  and the stylus is tiny  so I won t be using it much.
sensitive stylus so really your only cheaper options are older Notes  which don t have security updates.
                 review header   Great phone with disappointing stylus
--------------------------------------------------------
bixby  2
One of my favorite Bixby features is the ability to create Bixby commands.
As an aside  Bixby hasn t been developed to the point of being reliable  but I m sure Samsung will improve on it quickly.
Bixby is amazing once u get to know it.
It feels kinda scattered a bit like a few little  though creative and cool  Bixby  apps  that can do specific things by themselves but work together with an otherwise pretty basic Bixby assistant.
At first I was a little annoyed with the Bixby key  Not Bixby  just the key.
Second  Bixby.

card  -2
I tried to reinsert the card numerous times and the restart of phone got old really fast.
Samsung Pay is also a great feature because it doesn t rely on NFC and doesn t use your original card numbers.
So many features  so slim and powerful  amazing camera  great sound and options to change the sound  SD card capable  as with rest of Samsungs  great battery life  alternative security features.
The eject pinhole and the microphone pinhole are exactly the same size  and the official instruction website just shows a wireframe black rectangle and says stick the pin into the corresponding hole  so it s unclear which one you need to jam the needle tip into to pop the SIM card drawer open to install a microSD card .

display  2
                 review header   Great phone  however the curved display is incredibly fragile
A lot of people buying a Note are looking for the largest display they can get and still be practical to have on their person all the time.
The display is sharp and clear.
Camera is laser fast with taking clear photos videos  which was what I need with a toddler running around the house  u2022 Display is brilliant and has a Blue Filter to reduce glare and eyestrain  u2022 Flashlight brightness can be adjusted  u2022 Micro SD card slot is always a plus  u2022 Great signal strength  even with Military Grade Samsung Kickstand Case installed.
You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market.
moreover Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has a new end to end display which is the most sharp display with super amolded screen 4.
                 review text   Great phone  however the curved display is incredibly fragile.
Why bend the edges of that premium display so that 5  of display real estate is now distorted  Also  how do people use these phones without a case without inadvertently activating something on the screen  Stupid.
The display is very crisp and bright and I like the fact you can change the default resolution of it.
Great display  great pictures and everything you could want in a phone.
The phablet itself is well made  and the display looks good when looking directly at it.
The display is very good.
Give me back the display real.

Some people likes the clean Android version by Google  but for me  I love the way Samsung tweaked the Android OS and added many customization to enhance the user experience.
Overall  the best Android phone for those who want a big screen and think the pen is handy  like me.
3  Unless you manually change the resolution from 1080p to the advertised 1440p  the screen is not even as sharp as the Iphone 7  and much worst than other Android flagships running at 1440p.
It s fast and fluid and because it s Android  heavily modifiable  unlike Apple anything .
Previously used a Note 2 so it had been some time since I last used Android.
Cons  1  Camera looks good for social media because of the brightness and and oversaturated colors but actually has very little detail when you zoom in compared to Iphone 7  and other Android flagships such as HTC U11.

verizon  -1
The one I received was intended for Verizon and as such  came with all the Vz bloatware and a  This is not a Verizon Sim card  message when I restart the phone.
Nowhere on Amazon s webpage or Samsung s webpage or Verizon s webpage do they warn you that critical features will be blocked by Verizon or other wireless carriers.
However I did not find out until it was too late to return it that Verizon won t allow its voice mail app to be put onto unlocked phones.
By the way  I m using it on Verizon and it s working great.
Visual voicemail is a critical feature  it allows you to see a list of your voicemail and play them at your convenience  no need to dial into Verizon basic voicemail and listen to the massively annoying and slow process of hearing your voicemail read back by a robot.

review text great  1
Great call quality  does everything I want it for.
Camera is laser fast with taking clear photos videos  which was what I need with a toddler running around the house  u2022 Display is brilliant and has a Blue Filter to reduce glare and eyestrain  u2022 Flashlight brightness can be adjusted  u2022 Micro SD card slot is always a plus  u2022 Great signal strength  even with Military Grade Samsung Kickstand Case installed.
                 review text   great product
                 review text   working great

case  -1
The curved screen is beautiful but makes it very difficult to protect in a case  which you are definitely going to need one.
Much easier to use with a case.
I highly recommend getting the Tech 21 Brand case  which is very strong and durable case.

operating system  1
If you don t want to put 256  put 128  or 64 or however much your wallet can afford  which leads me to the second point  2  Options  So many options  I ve dealt with android before so I know most of this has to do with the operating system  but there is so much you can do with this device in the way of customizing the performance  maintaing battery life  personalizing the interface  and increasing productivity to your hearts content.

button  1
The button is so close to the volume buttons  it often causes screw ups.
Getting rid of the physical home button was long over due.
And it s pretty annoying that Samsung saw fit to put in a dedicated button for it.
AGAIN BIXBY BUTTON  makes it hard to tell which way the phone is up or down  when used in the dark .
I never realized how much I used the back button until I got the Note 8.
If only it didn u2019t constantly crash IG and have to be restarted  refuse to give me access to recent pics unless restarted  have the smallest keyboard with the send button right next to the delete button so I keep sending customers half written messages  and the worst auto correct program I u2019ve ever encountered  I might have more good things to say.
Either you are going to need to invest some time with this to get it to work right or you will be annoyed that it wastes a whole button just for its operation.
