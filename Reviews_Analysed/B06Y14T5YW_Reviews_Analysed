good phone  37
I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A  in that regard.
                 review text   I u2019ll keep my iPhone but it u2019s ok I guess.
I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the  1 000 level but  IMHO  it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck

                 review text   Excellent product.
                 review text   Such a wonderful device.
If you have the device that is working perfectly fine  I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1.
Good product.
After reading reviews explaing how Samsung has been releasing phones for years with technology that Apple now says is revolutionary with their Iphone X  my decision was easily made.
                 review text   It was supposed to be a used device with some signs of use and some cosmetic damage  BUT it is a shoddily repaired rebuilt device  most likely prior cracked front screen from whoever owned it previously .
When I received my phone  I tried to register it on the Samsung website and received the error message   Possible reasons for the error include serial IMEI number is not valid  product is older than 3 years  product was purchased outside the U. S. Contacted Amazon  and a replacement phone was sent out.
You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market.
We are Prime members so we knew we would be ok for the first couple of weeks if we had any problems with the product  but so far  all is good  Very happy.
I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card  which is allowed with this device  and it worked fine ever since I bought it.
                 review text   Product is great.
                 review text   Great product  fast  stylish.
review text   Why was I so loyal to the iPhone for so long  The Galaxy makes the iPhone look like a toy that you would give to a small child to keep them busy.
The phone is not compatible with T. Mobile.
                 review text   excellent product and great services
If you re switching from an iOS device  or simply aren t into customizing your experience AND you don t mind not having advertised SD card support  go for it.
                 review text   excellent product and great seller
The S8 is a beautiful piece of work that I ve become attached to and it is the best mobile device I ve owned this far
The iris scanner  my favorite  is super fast much better than the iPhone X.
Much better than the iPhone.

What an awesome device  incredible how quickly we move on to the  next best thing  this phone is still A  Download Nova Launcher and you have the finest phone on the market
This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.
review text   What I like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when I had it activated by T. mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data talk  and texted.
                 review text   Switched from an iPhone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down.
The phone s protection membrane is intact  but I still highly doubt that this is a return product from other

camera  23
The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe  next to the camera lens.
Everything is great  camera  wireless charging  face or fingerprint sign.
                 review text   excellent phone  good apps available  no loss of any functionality  in fact it s better than my iphone 6 I got rid of  good camera.
Wireless charging  great camera  decent battery and a perfect screen  After a month  I am so happy with my decision  Wonderful phone  perfect
                 review header   Can get enough of it  the camera is gorgeous .
The camera is great with an impressive zoom.
Camera is great in low light situations.
                 review text   Great phone everything anyone could need in a phone  extra slace water resistant  big  smooth nice camera  powerful fast wireless charging.
Camera is impressive  especially for night shots.
Camera  Excellent Battery  So far  excellent.
The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days  but after using it as your daily driver  you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn t pose much of a bother  unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.
The camera is amazing and touch screen works perfectly.
The camera is fantastic even in low light and it s super responsive.
so I went with Samsung  The camera is very good the screen quality is great.
Front camera was defective.
I ve dropped it twice onto concrete with no breaks or scratches The camera is great Since this is a unlocked phone you won t get some of ATT s extras like video calling.
review text   Can get enough of it   the camera is gorgeous  and the cpu runs smoothly.
                 review header   The camera is very good the screen quality is great
Camera  This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed.
Right next to the camera lense  come on.
The quality of the camera  which is important to me because I take a lot of pictures  is great and I like the sleek design.
Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick  that is awesome.
review text   If you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further.
The colors are vibrant  the camera s great not to mention lots of features.
I am still exploring it is sleek fast love the camera features very easy to transfer files to old phone to this one.
The camera is also pretty reasonable.
It is thin  perfect looking  brilliant camera.
The camera was really great and took quality photos.
Then there s smudge lint dust on the INSIDE of the rear and front camera lenses  shoddy repair job .
My S6 u2019s camera is still hard to beat  but for processing  graphics speed and display  and the extensible storage make this a clear winner
                 review text   Yah it s a cool phone where the screen goes around the edge of the phone and the camera is nice  but do you like to use Snapchat or the internet  Do you like to download apps then go on wifi  Well with this phone you can t do any of those things.
                 review text   Fast  good looking  good size  long battery  good sound  great camera  huge storage  never brakes.
Good camera  especially in low light.

bad battery  -15
So please  NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS  Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all.
                 review header   Great phone with long battery life and a nice interface
Very clear screen  long battery life  and connects with the Bluetooth in all my vehicles in 8 seconds or less and never fails to connect.
As stated in  7  it helps with battery life but other than that  it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity.
The first thing I noticed about the Samsung S8 is the significantly longer battery life.
                 review text   Fine device  water resistant  fast  and has a long battery life.
Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick  that is awesome.
looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone s functionality for significantly longer battery life.
This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone  Good camera  long battery life  adjustable storage  crisp display  and functional.
The permanent battery such too that will cost a lot of money to replace in the future.
The lowest I have had the battery is about 60  and it charged in under an hour.
Every time I let the phone get to 40  or less battery life  and plug it in  it automatically just shuts down completely.good battery life  23
Battery life is very good  also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger .
great battery life.
Disapointed in the battery life  not nearly as good as all the hype.
I love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash.
                 review text   Great Phone  fast  Good battery life.
Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick  that is awesome.
Simply put  the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well.
Very good battery life.
Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.
a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with.
Painless switchover  Battery is better than my S6  not twice the life of when the Sy was new  but significantly longer between charges.
With all of those phones I was happy from purchase  to replacement  usually fleeting battery life .
                 review text   The best cell phone in 2017  the battery is very good
Good battery life.
This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone  Good camera  long battery life  adjustable storage  crisp display  and functional.
It seems to have a better battery life  for now  You can buy your own additional memory without paying apple.
i am getting good battery life.
Great battery life.
It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings.
                 review text   Very good battery life  Front.
I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text  so it doesn t seem to consume much battery even if it s. .
It just works and the battery life is amazing.
                 review text   Fast  good looking  good size  long battery  good sound  great camera  huge storage  never brakes.

a screen protector  17
The edgeless screen made me nervous at first  but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay.
beautiful screen just love my s8 plus.
Very nice screen and overall a great phone.
It s slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case.
in  the built in speakers  the gorgeous screen  the headphone jack  .
Firstly  the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now.
I got the S8  as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job .
Haven t had any problems with the phone and am loving the larger screen.
The screen is vibrant.
looking phone  but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years  I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately.
I do not see this as a negative still  just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro s section  the overall screen size is perfect.
Wireless charging  great camera  decent battery and a perfect screen  After a month  I am so happy with my decision  Wonderful phone  perfect
The Screen is sharp and bright  just like prior Galaxy phones.
the reason I only give it 3 stars is the edge screen is very easy to touch and easily changes things just by holding the phone.
The curved screen doesn t cause issues with the touch screen while using it one.
                 review text   It was supposed to be a used device with some signs of use and some cosmetic damage  BUT it is a shoddily repaired rebuilt device  most likely prior cracked front screen from whoever owned it previously .
Battery life is amazing for a large screen.
Screen was perfect.
The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered  which was very convenient.
Last week I installed Samsung Smart Switch on my PC to back up my files  it showed me the option that I could update the software through this app  but after a while it just took me to a blue screen  now my cellphone is useless  it doesnt accept the emergency software recovery or any other option.
Aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous.
The curved screen allows for you to grip it easily and is a pleasure to look at with the sharp screen when reading or watching videos.
The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy.
If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet  there s NO way I d have bought this.
The camera is amazing and touch screen works perfectly.
The new screen off feature is too good.
Screen is beautiful.
I like the unusual screen shape  which is a bit longer than typical  which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super.
Other than the screen breaking twice in two months.
The screen is great and the phone is fast  responsive and well designed.
Not to mention power it uses  data it uses  and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen.
sometime it I see completely black screen while I am middle of something.
I was a little unsure about the curved screen at first but it I actually love the look and feel of it now.
I m sad to see the S Pen go  it wasn t worth spending another  350 for the Note 8  but I m impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels.
The screen is nice and large  responsive  good speakers  I like the water resistant design  and the swag is great  comes with the charger w  USB cable  a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone  and a set of headphones.
Stunning screen  sleek lines  all the sensors you would ever need  and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen.
                 review header   Screen was perfect.
Half the screen is even still empty.
The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio.
SO VOIDED MFG WARRANTY B  the clicking clacking area is a weakspot for the screen made worst because that s where the 3d touch home button is ALONG with it being a ingress point for condensation water dust Apart from all that  the battery discharge rate is pretty high even at idle.
review text   Best phone I ve ever owned very fast great screen and sound just awsome.

price review text  15
                 review text   That was a great price.
I really wanted it in orchid gray but the black was on sale for significantly cheaper  I believe the full price is about  750.
Great phone at a great price.
                 review text   Relative to what I would have paid if I d gone full price  I m happy with the phone overall.
                 review header   Very Satisfied  and excellent price
Great phone at a great price
Buying it off amazon will still save a few hundred bucks opposed to getting it on a plan through carrier because the carriers total price is higher.

Cheaper than usual price but quality is excellent.

                 review text   Great price and works great
                 review header   Gorgeous device at a great price.

                 review header   Good phone at great price.
For this price  I would recommend getting this phone  Just rember to keep it protected no matter what  Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers

bad phpone  -15
review text   BEWARE  99  of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS  People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon.
Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds  I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.
Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button  also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.
I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.
ish Feel  Just great and not cheap Headphone Jack  No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation  buttons on bottom.
The phone s protection membrane is intact  but I still highly doubt that this is a return product from other
                 review header   Beautiful powerful waterproof device.
I activated the new T. Mobile sim card with my existing account and all my data from my old galaxy phone got transferred smoothly.
I wouldn t have minded a used device with some signs of use and scratches here and there  BUT the bad repair job means that A  it wasn t repaired by a certified repair place.
Should have switched from my iPhone long time back.
After registration of my product with Samsung   9 months left on the warranty  so phone was most likely a return because someone ordered the wrong product then sent it back.

fast  11
Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful  Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8 s with no lies or gimmicks.
The finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too.
Upgrading from an S5  this phone is super fast and after taking it to t. mobile to get the micro sim card  works flawlessly.
                 review text   An awesome smartphone and with the best ratio between quality and price  nice looking  fast and well done  It s great
The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.
                 review text   The phone is awesome  super fast and  very easy to use.
So  does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won t be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business  I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.
Overall this is very slick  fast  and high.
                 review text   Fast  good looking  good size  long battery  good sound  great camera  huge storage  never brakes.

display  9
By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080  which is fine for me.
less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable.
Display looks very nice.
From wireless charging  fast charging  the Iris scanner  and the gorgeous display.
Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal  to put it mildly.
Very nice display and good sound .
gorgeous display   seriously you will fall in love with this bezeless beauty  .
Beautiful display and great graphics.
                 review text   Awesome phone  Pros  Amazing  super amazing  display awesome aesthetics  the phone is very sleek  lightweight Cons  Awkward position for a fingerprint sensor.
Sharp display  clear camera images with AF.
You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market.
The display is absolutely amazing.
At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it  go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it  but it s just not the same as owning it.
I would also recommend to get a protector case  the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn t want to crack this amazing display  and a screen protector.
It looks and feels small  but the display is amazing.
The battery life is amazing  for a phone with such a sharp and bright display  and also considering the hardware.
This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone  Good camera  long battery life  adjustable storage  crisp display  and functional.
Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don t have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night.
Sharp display
In this moment this is absolutely best smartphone with amazing display and proper size.
Display is mediocre  hence the four stars .
I can get a flat display again 2.
less curved display looks amazing  and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage.

Cheaper than usual price but quality is excellent.
picture quality if awesome
I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories.
video recording is very high quality too.
Brand new and high quality product.

months  -8
This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months.
There is just so much of it  After using this phone for a couple months  I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.
                 review text   I have had this phone for several months now.
I have owned this now for several months and no problems.
I decided to keep the phone because I am switching providers within the next few months and rather not buy another phone.
Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple s strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn t make sense to me  it makes you think.
                 review header   He has had it for months now and it works great.
phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera

I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.

However  after less than two months the speaker is terrible.

thing  8
review text   This phone is one of the best phone I ever had I m very happy with that but the best thing is for the internet and videos and pic.
So  after a month of aggravation  I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for.
                 review header   this thing is amazing.
No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor.
There was no mention of it until I asked a rep  and good thing I did .
I LOVED my S5 so easy to use but now every little thing is a chore.
I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger  because of the wrapping edges of the screen .
The first thing I noticed about the Samsung S8 is the significantly longer battery life.
What an awesome device  incredible how quickly we move on to the  next best thing  this phone is still A  Download Nova Launcher and you have the finest phone on the market
Same thing as bixby almost  but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on.
It is a very easy thing to provide complete coverage for all customers regardless of their phones.
Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.
Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won t let you disable.
It s like thinking you re buying a used car just by going off of what the seller is advertising as a clean used car  but you re actually getting a rebuilt totaled car  which in itself could be a good thing discount wise  BUT there are definitely underlying problems
The build quality of this thing is amazing.
review text   I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8  forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone  duration time doesn t work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things  like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn t work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8  and one other thing it s a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10  like it s nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it s mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT  jenifferfoster8 gmail.
To put it bluntly  this thing is amazing.
Also that bixby thing is terrible.

apps  7
                 review text   excellent phone  good apps available  no loss of any functionality  in fact it s better than my iphone 6 I got rid of  good camera.
Rather than several pages with apps  you can still do that  there is an edge  tray  that you can use to easily access your favorite apps.
The phone looks great  comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up.
Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all  such as cycletrader app .
There are some apps available to download so this really isn t an issue.
installed apps to be usefull.
You will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one.
There s no carrier bloatware on it so you don t have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you ll never use  but it still comes with most of the basic apps you ll need.
It was great that they included some apps with a new phone  I get that.
If you don t prefer it  there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.
review text   Great phone if you like being able to run multiple apps at the same time along with all the other features it offers.
Samsung apps are excellent great improvements over stock Android.
the edges make it difficult to hold without triggering certain apps unintentionally.
A feature that I have come to use quite a bit  with widgets and fast opening of certain apps  is the Edge.

warranty  6
                 review text   The US Warranty listed is not valid.
I also read in their warranty for cell phones  see attached screenshot  that  During the applicable warranty period  provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty  Samsung will repair or replace the Product  at Samsung u2019s sole option  without charge.
After spending an hour with Samsung customer service per the number in the warranty listing  the phone does NOT have a US Warranty available.
I do recommend a LifeProof case  Fre  it makes it water proof for those who do not want to scratch the screen it s warranty is great.
Unfortunately  I didn t see a link to getting an extended warranty.
However Amazons warranty is not so great.

service  5
After about a month or two of me having service under metro pcs  yes i know they arent the best  my phone randomly started saying that i couldnt receive service anymore.
I have absolute perfect 4GLTE service with cricket wireless Since I got this device .
                 review text   Excellent service  rapid delivery  got it in less than two days.
bought this phone 6months ago and it still works great  I have changed different service providers and have .
Two stars for now since Amazon customer service is replacing it  once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem restarts at random 15.
If anyone lives in NYC Metro area  you should visit Samsung 837  great service  great experience and they do not try to sell  they just show the products and explain .
Samsung is worst service.
review text   I bought this phone 6months ago and it still works great  I have changed different service providers and have had no problems like I ve had with proprietary phones from the companies.
I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT T and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes.
The charges for service are the same  but the service area is limited  making an independent purchase a bad decision.
Carriers will not offer coverage for full service area to an unlocked phone not purchased through them.
I was able to transfer my service to this phone with no problems.

bixby button  -5
Voice Command  Samsung has added a new  Bixby  to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon s Alexa  Apple s Siri  and Google s Assistant.
Well all except poor Bixby.
I just want to change the wallpaper for pete s sake  And the Bixby key  So many people don t want your Bixby key  plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen.
Bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.
Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is  how the battery isn t as good as other Samsung phones  and the list can go on and on.
The new  Bixby  feature is a huge disappointment.
review text   The phone is great  but Bixby is nonresponsive the majority of the time when trying to use voice wake up.
Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left  which you will be mistakenly hitting often  you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing  but you can t seem to reassign the button to be useful  or completely get rid of Bixby .
There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions command.
Also Bixby works fine with the  poorly placed  Bixby button.
I do wish there was a way to easily disable Bixby.
The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung.
Same thing as bixby almost  but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on.
I m glad that Samsung has added a  disable  feature  but remapping that button would be great.
If you are as frustrated as I am then I recommend you uninstall Bixby and switch over to the Google Suite of services.
As it is  that s a dead button that you ll press once out of curiosity  and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume.
I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen  and keep all my apps on a single page  in folders  the weather  a google search bar with the mic button  and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto.
The bad  Bixby is not what it s cracked up to be in my opinion.
Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it s no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways  home button not as receptive  Bixby button finicky  and still no fingerprint shooting method .
I haven t used bixby due to the reviews but I m fine without it.
Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when need.
No hard button on the front.
Bixby is useless.
There s a dedicated Bixby button  which is located directly across from the power button  which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you re pushing the power button.
except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.
Preloaded apps and bixy button are painful.
this is especially true of the bixby app which i don u2019t use.

a sim card  -5
I did have to go in and get a new SIM card however  since my old one was a micro.
party retailer  and they gave me a SIM card for free.
                 review text   Just received my new phone in the mail  Looks real nice  Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint  my service provider  in order to use it  Fortunately  they told me the sims card is free  and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there  We shall see
Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim  so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size.
So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read   not a verizon sim card  anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes  the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up.
The only thing we had to do was visit a Sprint store to get it properly activated with a new SIM card  but that was easy and free  even on the day after Christmas.
Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up.
Just buy a new sim card and call the customer support instead of going into a store.
I went to the verizon store so they could help me active the phone  since I need a new SIM card.
Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card  I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.
review text   I have read a lot on this phone and the reviews do not give it justice  on an unlock phone I had no problem going through Verizon to get a SIM s card  my Galaxy Note 4 had a larger card.
Still had to go to the carrier since its SIM card is smaller than micro
I went to the Sprint store because they need to use a different SIM card  but it was done for free.
I got the phone  had Verizon pop my Sim card in and it was ready to use.

                 review header   Works on Verizon with proper SIM card
There s less garbage on it from the carrier  and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled .

verizon  -4
Well  it wasn t. Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon.
This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great  however  the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a  Verizon Branded  S8.
When I put my AT T sim card in it  it seemed to work  but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying  not a Verizon sim card  error message in the notification tray.
It s unlocked  so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network  I knew it would  having read the reviews at Amazon  and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.
                 review text   The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.
review text   Great deal  Verizon will act stupid when you try to switch your phone.
So if you are worried that this might not work with Verizon  don t be scared.

cosmetic damage  3
In conclusion  if I wanted a repaired rebuilt device  I would ve gone in that category instead  BUT used with cosmetic damage in my dictionary doesn t mean repaired rebuilt.
99  knowing it had cosmetic damage and used.
                 review text   It was supposed to be a used device with some signs of use and some cosmetic damage  BUT it is a shoddily repaired rebuilt device  most likely prior cracked front screen from whoever owned it previously .

issues  -3
                 review header   This is a good phone with some major issues
Outside of that  this is a great phone and I d recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues
                 review text   Love it  looks great  no issues getting it synced with my carrier.
Honestly don t enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors  but I couldn t pass up the sale on the phone.
Besides the no texting problem  the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is  .
The only real issues I personally have with it are the Samsung pre.
There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience  former Touchwiz  I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all  and doesn t hinder day to day use  but they are there.
Now learning that Droids were targeted with the most privacy issues.
                 review text   This is a good phone with some major issues.
--------------------------------------------------------
great only problem  -3
When I attempted to register it  I had the same problem.
The last problem I couldn t get over was the alarm volume.
                 review header   Great cellphone but came with a software problem  not it s useless
                 review header   Phone looks and works great  The only problem is that Boost Mobile could .
I even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that I did.
But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem.
A more recent problem I ve discovered is if you re listening to music the music will just stop playing until you unplug and replug the headphones in.

everything  3
rest everything is deluce
                 review text   i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly.
                 review text   Great product and everything was the same as published
                 review header   i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly
everything is faster and more responsive.
                 review text   Great phone no problems  everything is perfect .
This is one of the best phones I ve had  its really fast and you can customize everything  One thing I would like to point out  wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about  is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service  so this is what I did  grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8  it worked for me.
                 review header   Everything good except charger
Everything else is great but I have press really hard to type anything.
                 review header   Everything went perfect
The packing was new  everything came out of the package as expected  charger  earphones  etc  Just a reminder  if you are going to use it somewhere else  do not forget to buy yourself a plug adapter  since the one that comes out of the box is the US plug.
Didn u2019t know much about purchasing a phone online so glad everything worked out well.
I am amazed with this phone  everything about it is so good.
and pretty snappy  too  Everything is working great.
--------------------------------------------------------
google assistant  3
I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out.
She s not Siri  but I think she is better than Google s personal assistant.
--------------------------------------------------------
software  3
It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.
I have come to expect this with any major software hardware upgrade so it s hardly worth mentioning.
The SOFTWARE is absolutely horrible.
                 review header   Good quality and camera  but laggy software and bad fingerprint placement
Frankly  there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn t able to be disabled.
Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won t let you disable.
00 USD plan to nix the special software nonse and give me a stock Android experience.
prone with the latest software updates.
The software is also quite nice.
But ultimately I didn t enjoy the Samsung skin over Android  and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3.
I recommend using Google or Verizon s cloud backup or some other software  like Samsung Kies  to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
issue  -3
This is not a samsung issue  but android.
I was planning on doing it myself online  but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself  the online tool wasn t accepting the numbers .
The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS.
With that said  the first issue is still a concern.
that has been my only issue and ive had the phone for nearly a year in 3 months.
The second issue has been less of a concern for me.
--------------------------------------------------------
low light  -2
Only minor con is that it s not amazing in low light  using ProMode helps a bit though  .
Good camera  especially in low light.
The camera is fantastic even in low light and it s super responsive.
--------------------------------------------------------
back  2
Opposed to contrary belief  the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive .
--------------------------------------------------------
looks  2
Looks really good.
                 review text   Just received my new phone in the mail  Looks real nice  Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint  my service provider  in order to use it  Fortunately  they told me the sims card is free  and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there  We shall see
review text   Phone looks and works great  The only problem is that Boost Mobile could not activate it due to carrier technology incompatibility.
Looks great in our hands.

review text so  2
review text   I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8  forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone  duration time doesn t work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things  like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn t work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8  and one other thing it s a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10  like it s nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it s mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT  jenifferfoster8 gmail.
                 review text   so far so good
                 review text   So upset i receive the package with things i never order.
                 review text   So very  very glad that I purchased this wonderful phone  I had a Galaxy S4 for two years before purchasing this phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
review header one  2
                 review header   is wonderful  there is none like this
                 review header   200 less then t. mobile store for same phone
                 review header   good phone
                 review header   great phone.
                 review header   In general I wasted my time and also my money
                 review header   I am happy with my new phone
                 review header   Other than that I love this phone
--------------------------------------------------------
personal preference  2
I chose the basic setting  but there is even an option to change balance which let s you arrange a set of liked color boxes  whites  and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference.
Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.
The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level  which can be changed to your personal preference  is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.
--------------------------------------------------------
case  2
The edgeless screen made me nervous at first  but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay.
Highly recommend a good case for this phone  .
the other is easily covered with a case.
A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked.
Had no issues powering the device on out of the box  and it even came with a complimentary case.
Get a good case.
Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges  cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible.
3 feet  face down and in its case  and it s been fine.
It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.
handed  too  even with a heavier case.
--------------------------------------------------------
face recognition  2
The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient.
Very happy with the phone  face recognition is better than I expected.
--------------------------------------------------------
things  -2
Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.
One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can t be disabled or turned off.
Some of it is true  but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don t discuss on their channel.
                 review text   Too many stupid initialization pop ups that keep happening as new things are opened and used.
However  all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost  1 000 whereas the S8  through Amazon was markedly cheaper.
                 review header   Great hardware but two things that make it terrible
One thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is  like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things  face up others  tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently  basically I d have to spend many hours figuring it out that s the only thing but I guess there are bigger problems out there.
review text   I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8  forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone  duration time doesn t work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things  like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn t work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8  and one other thing it s a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10  like it s nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it s mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT  jenifferfoster8 gmail.
So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue  the same things I just spent 3 hours trying.
I love the little things about it.
                 review text   Great hardware but two things that make it terrible.
So i order this galaxy s8 phone i order a case and a screen protector NONE of those item i got in the box when it arrived i open the box and it had random things that i never ordered and NO PHONE just an empty box
--------------------------------------------------------
days  -2
If one already has a Samsung  it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.
                 review text   Excellent service  rapid delivery  got it in less than two days.
It looked pretty new  I have been using it for a few days now and it works well.
The device has been restoring media for several days with a current recovery progress of 11   73 MB out of 656 MB  the wireless charger stops working continuously and the Wi.
Sometimes it lasts 2 days  and sometimes less than 1.
It took too long to get supposed to be 2 days.
The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days  but after using it as your daily driver  you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn t pose much of a bother  unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.
                 review text   I ve only had the phone for 2 full days so I m still learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
edge  2
It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display.
I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me  but I could no longer deal with old phones.
I am very glad they ve introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series.
--------------------------------------------------------
version of android  -2
                 review text   The Galaxy S8 is a wonderful phone with a fairly streamlined experience compared to other Android phones I ve had.
The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version  plain and simple.
Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android.
Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box.
Better software controls because unlike iOS  android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.
                 review text   I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2.
One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.
Initially hesitant to use Android starting with the HTC Evo  but eventually after testing out Samsung Galaxy line  I decided it s worth a shot.
review text   Sleek design  light weight and best android phone in this price range.
Updates are slow  especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android.
Software might not be to everyone s liking but it s the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like.
If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware  this is not the phone for you.
--------------------------------------------------------
ear buds  1
By far some of the best I have owned  as far as ear buds go  and you don t have to pay for good quality here.
The charger  an earpiece with extra ear buds  an eject pin for the sim card slot came in the box.
--------------------------------------------------------
want  -1
A quality handset that isn t hobbled by software and apps they don t want and can t disable.
--------------------------------------------------------
awkward position  -1
Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.
--------------------------------------------------------

review header samsung  1
Overall I m very happy with the Samsung Galaxy S8.
ware onto their phones this is the last Samsung phone I would ever get.
Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is  how the battery isn t as good as other Samsung phones  and the list can go on and on.
It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan  Guys at  Samsung 837  are great.
review text   I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8  forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone  duration time doesn t work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things  like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn t work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8  and one other thing it s a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10  like it s nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it s mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT  jenifferfoster8 gmail.
Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android.
But  surprise  Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.
It s US Warranty phone but doesn t cover the same as a store bought or direct Samsung bought.
This phone is fast and I was able to transfer all of my apps with Samsung smart switch app easy as pie.
                 review text   Paid for a used damaged package Samsung 8 And received a Brand new Samsung 8 unused and untouched.
                 review text   Outstanding replacement for my old Samsung SII which started acting a little funny.
My first Samsung phone and maybe my last.
this is my third Samsung and I have been very satisfied with them all.
                 review header   this is my third Samsung and I have been very satisfied with them all
This will honestly be my last Samsung phone .
That said  Google  Nexus and Pixel  and Apple already patched their respective devices  but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack.
This was the straw that broke the camel s back and I couldn t forgive Samsung for all the things I didn t like about the phone.
I m glad that Samsung has added a  disable  feature  but remapping that button would be great.
I  m very happy with my new Samsung it s new.
                 review header   Amazing phone hardware with pathetic Samsung.
Samsung just recently made it possible to disable  but not remap  the button.
I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes.
The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer.
The screen is nice and large  responsive  good speakers  I like the water resistant design  and the swag is great  comes with the charger w  USB cable  a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone  and a set of headphones.
It s extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.
best samsung so far .
You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.

learning curve  1
There s a little bit of a learning curve  but so far so good I love the phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
problems  -1
There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems.
I don t mind the used cosmetic state  since I use a case  of the device  BUT the BAD REPAIR JOB  along with that the device probably doesn t have any MFG warranty anymore  voided from the bad repair job  and the nonexistence of any IP68 water dust resistance  due to bad repair job again  just wants me to stay away from this device and potential problems it could give me  if it can last 2 years .
--------------------------------------------------------
amazon  1
300 less than anywhere else  As directed by AT T I only had to insert the Sim card from my J7 and it was good to go instantly  I couldn t be happier with my unlocked S8 at this spectacular Amazon Prime price
                 review header   Amazon always make me happy.
However  all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost  1 000 whereas the S8  through Amazon was markedly cheaper.
                 review text   I purchased a  like new   from Amazon with the Earth Day deal.
It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex.
Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I ve seen multiple posts online about this being an issue.
Amazon got it here in less than 48 .
This phone is  756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.

fingerprint  1
                 review header   Good quality and camera  but laggy software and bad fingerprint placement
--------------------------------------------------------
metro pcs  -1
after taking it yo metro pcs  i was told they cannot really help me because it was not purchased from.
--------------------------------------------------------
operating system  -1
It s so far removed from vanilla android it s like a completely different operating system  and you ll CONSTANTLY be annoyed with popups  nuisance reminders  and other annoyances.
--------------------------------------------------------
third party  -1
Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don t take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.
--------------------------------------------------------
time  1
                 review text   It was delivered on time as expected and to sum it up it is just perfect
                 review text   This is the first time I got a new phone and wasn t upset about it.
This is my first time buying something else.
                 review text   Arrived on time and is unlocked.
Sure it can do some cool stuff  but 90  of the time it s not helpful.
So good I bought 2 at the same time cuz I wanted to enjoy it twice as much.
I ve been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days  and this is by far  the WORST phone I have ever encountered  and I even had the Note 7 for a short time .
You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time  one will have a slight delay though .
                 review text   i am having a hard time settin this up.
It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.
                 review text   Received quickly  phone activated with no issues on Sprint network since I had ordered the SIM at the same time.
Besides the no texting problem  the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is  .
                 review text   It s a nice phone only problem I have is the HD Voice  WiFi Calling  and VoLTE Voice over LTE   the feature that allows you to use data and Voice at the same time doesn t work  but I love it I m hoping this will change when I receive my replacement unit but I love it  And I love Amazon  They have really impressed me  Kudos to Samsung and Amazon
review text   For the first time ever  I received a phone exactly as it s described.
review text   Great phone if you like being able to run multiple apps at the same time along with all the other features it offers.
review text   I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8  forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone  duration time doesn t work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things  like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn t work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8  and one other thing it s a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10  like it s nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it s mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT  jenifferfoster8 gmail.
I haven t had any drops or water issues with the phone  so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.
In general I wasted my time and also my money.
First time samsung Galaxy user.
