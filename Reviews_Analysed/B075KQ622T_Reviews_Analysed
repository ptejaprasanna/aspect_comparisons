camera  10
I also bought but never much used the Nokia Lumia 1020  better camera but lousy OS .
Best camera ever.
CAMERA The main camera is excellent  producing clear  detailed and colorful shots that are worthy.
The S pen is awesome  and has a great camera.
This supposedly great dual camera works fine.
So this dual camera isn t that attractive to me.
The camera is also amazing.
                 review text   It is a great phone and I switched from Apple to Samsung and I was surprised that it would be better that my iPhone 7  it has a better camera  a stylus  and so many features that makes it better

note  7
This is my third note  Note original  Note 3  and this one .
Having it is definitely worth it and it makes the Note series stand out.
If you use will use S pen extensively  and or seeking upgrade from Note 4  5 and 7 FE  then it s for you.
It is also a o lot faster than my Note 3  but that s probably because my Note 3 was very old.
                 review header   International model Note 8 not serviceable in the USA
Even used it for a phone  Now that I have the Note 8  the old Note 3 seems suddenly so old and slow and clunky.
                 review header   The best note
I was very pleased with the Note 5  so I couldn t wait to upgrade to the Note 8.

bad battery  -1
But if battery life is still your main concern  then simply put battery saving mode  and you will be fine since there isn t much of performance loss from it.good battery life  6
removable battery.
Glad I did  The battery life has been great.
I was a bit concerned about the battery life  but after using the phone for a few days I can confirm that the battery is great as well.
But nobody sells a removable battery anymore.
Battery life is decent.
I had S7 edge with 3 600 mAh before and surprisingly  I feel both have similar battery life  so no complaing for me.

international model  -4
                 review text   While choosing dual sim clearly shows international version in the product title  the single sim version doesn t however I can confirm it is an international model.
                 review text   I must say that I have been a user of the range note from the number 1 I have had all including the 7 the phone is absolutely spectacular order it in blackI have no complaints I did a market study since all my life I have used cell phones of 1 single sim and the one they were offering is double sim it s exactly the same the same features the model is 950F   DS I only use one sim buy a micro sd of 128 gigs and perfect.
While I was informed it would be covered by Samsung s 1 year warranty even with it being an international model because I purchased it from an authorized USA dealer  sold and shipped by Amazon  I ended up returning it.
Why  While Samsung support will say the phone will be covered under warranty  in practice you won t be able to get it service as the Samsung repair centers won t touch international model phones.
2  this one is not entirely about the phone but more of the accessories it came with  since this is the international model it has a Europe charger but they did provide an adapter but it just makes the charger even more bulky.

The handwriting recognition is one of its best features.
The phone is packed with lots of features and I love every single one of them  Some examples are the edge screen  the off screen notes  the always on display  etc.

There are far too many unique features to talk about.
Love all of the new features
