                "review_text": "Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10. TL;DR Gorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear AND front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and Bluetooth 5.0! On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback. It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience. CONS: 1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations. It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though). It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches. A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1). 2. Samsung is not very good with software updates. If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels. That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone. 3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times. Yes, I wish it was on the front. No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story). You know, we have this thing called \"muscle memory\".. It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems. If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8) 4. The phone has glass back that\u2019s prone to cracking, so watch out if you\u2019re clumsy. But see pro tip #1 5. S8 doesn\u2019t have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day. If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere. 6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera. Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG). An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6) UNIQUE ADVANTAGES 1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone. This doesn\u2019t really improve the functionality of the phone, but there\u2019s just something satisfying about this futuristic experience. 2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here. Always-on display is useful. 3. As of today, it\u2019s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0! 4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing. S8 is a first phone to come with this, and it\u2019s awesome. I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room. You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones. 5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet. PRO TIPS 1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (they\u2019re better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back. The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if you\u2019ve dropped your phone. Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that. Don\u2019t use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone! 2. Bixby is useless, and if you\u2019re like me, most \u201cSmart\u201d assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns. You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/ 3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you don\u2019t know what I mean) 4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life 5. Set screen resolution up to QHD. In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use. Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot. 6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20. They\u2019re less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside they\u2019re much more versatile and fun. 7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait. Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites. 8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast. In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be. If you wear glasses, register with glasses on. Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions. You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments. It's a really nice phone, highly recommended.",

After contacting Amazon customer rep several times and having them promising that they will issue a refund and submit an AZ claim to seller, they decided not to honour their statement and leave me with a broken phone for a misleading publication for a seller which obviously is NOT Customer centric.

How do I go about getting one of these and how much are they from you?\" This is what they replied with, \"we will ship you USA plug for it free of charge.\" All I did was click on seller information and put it in an \"ask a question.\" As for the phone it is very smart and connects well with other devices, such as a smart TV especially a Samsung Smart TV. Bixby is the \"siri\" for this device and works great. It adjusts to your needs and even tells you people who you frequently contact at a certain time.

                "review_text": "Don't get me wrong, it's a good phone. Battery life is good, and the display quality and camera are second to none. Unfortunately, there are a number of things about this phone that are so annoying that I'm looking to replace it a month after purchase. Granted, I'm kind of a phone snob, so these things might not bother others as much as they did me. So make this short, I'll make a list: -The curved screen means constantly missing buttons that are on the side of the screen. Good luck if you're playing a game. Alongside this, anything displayed is distorted along the sides. So TV shows and movies suffer. The side menu is (very) occasionally helpful, but hardly justifies the issues caused by the edges. If this is the alternative, then just include the side bezels. Really, the whole thing amounts to more of a novelty than something actually worthwhile. It's supposed to save space, but it doesn't. Which leads me to my next point: -This phone is huge. If you're looking for a normal-sized phone, this isn't one, despite being the smaller of the GS8's. Reaching across the screen requires constant repositioning and stretching. And if you have a case on it, it's a giant lump of tech in your pocket. Also: -The 18:9 resolution is pointless. Not only is every video ever shot in 16:9, but there's no way to globally keep the navigation bar displayed. If there was, the 18:9 display would be inconsequential (since you'd effectively have a 16:9 display). But since there isn't, you have a larger display area, but have to swipe up to show the navigation bar constantly. There seems to be some way to make it stay on screen on a per-app basis, but I've yet to figure out how. Reaching the status bar without repositioning your hand is hopeless, even with big hands. -Samsung's software is still incredibly laggy and bloated. After using a Pixel (1) for over a year, everything about it seems slow. Apps, games, web pages all load surprisingly slow for the hardware this phone is running, and scrolling constantly stutters. -The worst thing about this phone? The fingerprint sensor. Since Apple (Not a fan, but credit where it's due) pretty much perfected this tech a few years ago, it's been a pretty standard thing in the mobile world, and one that's expected to just work. But on the GS8, it's just abysmal. The sensor is in a terrible spot, is small and awkwardly shaped, and requires your finger to cover the entire sensor to work. So if your placement is even a little off, it won't work. It makes unlocking this phone a chore every. single. time. So every time, you have to approach the sensor from the top or bottom (it's rectangular). All this being said, there are a few features that I like about this phone. The always-on display is something that I really like about my GS7, and missed with my Pixel. (There are ways to have it with root, but nothing beats having something stock) Pixel and Nexus phones only allow tethering if you have a subscription through your provider (can override with root), but the GS8 has the check disabled stock, which is nice. The sheer number of people that have these phones makes rooting and DMverity defeat very easy. Overall, I think Samsung is starting to pull an Apple, where they're getting overly confident in their position in the mobile market and have turned to form over function. I've had a lot of phones over the years, starting with the original iPhone and averaging about a phone a year, and this is the first one that I immediately disliked (I do a lot of research before buying something that costs $600+). I'll probably be getting a Sony Xperia XZ2 compact (god their naming sucks) whenever I can get one for a decent price. The Z3 was one of the best phones I've owned (behind of course, the Nexus 5), and it seems like it's the phone I was hoping the GS8 would be.",

Even if they say they're turned off, they will come through whenever they're sent, think about it.This is my issue with the phone for the software, I come from having a note 3 and a note 5, I am basically spoiled by the notes, the screen is better in that I don't have to worry about a beveled screen.

The fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it's usable. it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and I have big hands. I love the pairing with the S3 Gear and the Samsung Health App. It has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode. I miss the dedicated silent button from the iPhone this needs to be UNLOCKED before I can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary Bixby button. There should be a silence button instead of that. The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it. Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8. Hope they'll come out with something better and I also hope Samsung LISTENS to users. We don't want the Bixby. We want to be able to remap and reconfigure anything this coudl be your true ace vs iPhone that will never allow it.",

Many games do not support Mail GPU, Like you use AMD graphics to play large 3D games it will has a lot of problems such as reboot, not support Anti-aliasing, Cannot open in-game special effect. Exynos is 14nm=8890, 10nm=8895 & 2.3+1.7GHz But Qualcomm is 10nm & 2.35+1.9GHz, Able to run at a higher frequency for more stable time. And the most important thing, The International version Exynos 8890 or 8895 Only support GSM unlock, But US version Qualcomm 835 Unlock the entire network CDMA and GSM, Meaning that you can use this phone at any network company in the world.",

I used to be a big fan of Samsung Galaxy phones. (Bought Google's Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S2, Note 3, Note 5) they were strong phones. now that I bought my Galaxy S8 it fell on the SOFT CARPET on the floor and the screen Shattered. now I regret purchasing this phone, but it is good to learn from our mistakes. :D and this is the last Samsung Product I ever purchase on the rest of my life.

Switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters. Although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but I had no clue what many of the passwords were. As I was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it. The mains charger has European prongs but I have many USB wall chargers so no big deal. The factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones. But the phone itself is a dream compared to an S5. So much quicker and no lags",

                "review_header": "Worst Customer Service Ever", 
                "review_text": "So, let me start off by saying that I really did love my expereince overall with this phone. It's fast, pretty, and top of it's class. That was until one day, my phone began to crash randomly throughout the day. I thought maybe it just needed a reset, so I did just that. The problem persisted yet, so I have Samsung a call, and this is where my experience with Samsung was shot down, strangled, and ground into dust. It began with my first couple customer calls, I followed all of their data reset regulations and yet the issues were still going on. So, they stated I needed to send the phone in and have it looked at and fixed before they could do anything else (which was totally fine with me the first time). I asked them about a loaner phone while mine is repaired, and they stated that my carrier provides that and they do not. So, I called my carrier and they stated that Samsung provides that and they do not. Very frustrated with that I called back and was told Samsung could not do anything, so I was stuck with a hand me down Iphone, but it is just a temporary phone, Right?...Wrong! but Ill get to that later. After waiting the 1.5 weeks to have my phone repaired and sent back I smiled as I opened the box and restored my phone, finally I could just get back to using it again. Skip ahead 12 hours when the issue is still happening! So I message there online care center using there online chat and there service representative informs me that if it is not working again, they will most likely get me an exchange device. They tell me to call the Executive care staff, but in order to get to them you must speak with their first level of customer service EVERY SINGLE TIME! No matter what you tell them or who's name you drop they always need the whole story and waste 30 minutes of your day before informing you that they need to escalate you to their executive customer care department (No lie, this happened to me every time I called until I stated I refuse to talk to them). Now, after that I spoke with a executive care assistant (ECA). They informed me that the person who told me that I could get an exchange was wrong and that there needs to be multiple repairs on a device before it can be exchanged and that it needs to be sent in AGAIN! Frustrated with the broken guarantee I asked to speak with a supervisor, the supervisor stated the same stuff that the ECA said but did state she could get me expedited shipping (Woohoo...). So again I packed my device and drove to a UPS and dropped it off, dreadfully sliding my sim card back into that Iphone. This time it only took 1.2 weeks (wow, what a difference) to get my phone back, and upon looking at the service receipt I noticed there was nothing marked as to what they performed, shrugging I thought maybe they just forgot. I restored my phone once more and yet again, it crashes not even 1 hour later. So a little peeved I call again (and go through the 30 minutes of the first representative :D) and after speaking with the ECA she states that it looks like they did a software update (rightttttttt) and then sent it back. I inform her that it is still having these issues, she then informed me that it still does not qualify for an exchange because there was not anything repaired the last time I sent it. Trying to control myself I ask her if there are any other options aside from sending it in again for weeks. She states sadly no and that she has no idea if I will ever be able to actually get an exchange or refund because it has to meet \"repair criteria\", again I angrily pack my phone up and ship it, waiting another 2 weeks to get my phone again because of the holidays. So I open the package when I get it back and don't even reset the piece of crap Iphone because I knew that it was going to happen once more. I guess right! The phone crashed again and again. So i call once more and this is were I just refuse to speak to the 1st level of help, sensing my frustration and probably looking back at my last couple notes they pass me along. Finally I am offered the exchange I wanted from November 2017. Mind you it is now the end of January! I give them all the information, give them all my receipts (which I luckily still had) and they stated they will email me with a shipping label and directions. So, I wait yet another week for them to contact me, puzzled I call them and they stated they have nothing in their system about an exchange. Taking a nice cleansing breath I try to not explode on this poor representative who can surely tell that I am not happy. At this point I demand a refund, the representative tries to persuade me otherwise but at this point I would never want to deal with this ever again if I have an issue down the road. So, she states that she will start the refund process, around 1.5 hours later she states it has been submitted and I will receive info within 2-3 business days. So, giving them a break I wait the full 3 days, and guess what? Still no emails or calls. I call again and I informed that they having nothing in their system about a refund, just information about an exchange. I laugh into the phone and say they must be joking, the ECA stated she is very sorry but they have no record and we must restart the process once more. I swallow my anger, trying to be a sensible and caring man and begin this 2 hour process once more, and this ECA gives me her direct line and email after the process is finished and states she will email me with updates to ensure that I get it done in a timely manner. So, I send my phone in once again! and this is in February at this point! Waiting a couple of days and not hearing anything I just email her, asking for an update, no answer! I try again a day later, and no answer once again. I give her direct line a call 2 times in 1 day and leave a kind message just asking for an update. Two days later I have yet to hear anything. So I call there ECA department once more and I am told that it can take 7-14 business days or 7-21 regular days for a refund to be issued. I tell them it has been nearly 2 weeks since my 1st attempt and over 1 week since I sent the device in and they just tell me that it is pending and I need to wait. So, I wait another 4 days, still no updates from anyone, my package tracking has been at there warehouse for over a week now because I can see it on UPS's website. I call very upset and speak to yet another ECA, he stated that he is sorry, and was confused as to why they have had it a week and why it was still pending. He informs me that the process has yet to even start. At this point I am frustrated yet again and demand to speak to a supervisor, he tries to tell me they can't do anything special, but at this point I need to let someone know my frustrations with this whole process. So, he transfers me and upon someone picking up they just hang up on me. So, I call again and I am told by the 1st level that the ECA told them that they have done all they can for me at this moment and that I need to wait (uh no, I am speaking to someone about this because at this point I deserve to be listened to), I wait on hold for over an hour to speak to the 1st level supervisor who literally picks up and tells me that she just needed to see what was wrong before she could transfer me. So, she transfers me and I wait another 45 minutes before speaking to the ECA supervisor. He tells e he is sorry and that he would personally email the refunds/exchange department to have my refund \"expedited\" I ask him to let me speak to them because it has been over 2.5 weeks since my initial call and I am paying for a phone that I haven't been able to use for months now. He informs me that they do not take calls and they can only be contacted by ECA through emails. Frustrated I hold my tongue and ask him for his direct line and email, he gives it to me and tells me to call him for any questions or updates and that the refund'exchange dept should get back to him that day and he would let me know their response. Nothing comes that day, or the next, or that week! So, I try to call that supervisor, no answer and I leave a message, no response 2 days later. I call yet again and jump through the hurdles and hoops, I am told that they are having issues with their computer system and that their accounting dept was closed the day before and that my refund is still pending (WHAT?!?!) I laugh yet again (because at this point I am just so shocked at how horrible this service is) and I am informed that I need to call again in 24 hours to see where it is at. At this point I am on day 19 of the 21 days they guaranteed (although from all the false guarantees I have gotten from them, I doubt it will be on time). I inform the ECA of this and she asks me to just be patient and \"they are doing their best\". I still have yet to get my money back, I am still paying for this phone which I literally have not been able to use since November. I have wasted HOURS of time speaking to this company and their service is so poor I can safely say that Samsung will not be a brand in my life or my families life. I hope that someone from this company gets to see this and fixes the issues. I hope that someone considering buying this phone reads this and takes into account what will happen if an issue arises. A multi- billion dollar company should not be making a customer jump though hoop after hoop to resolve a mistake THE COMPANY made. I just want to state that I normally am very understanding of mistakes and I have a great deal of patience for human error. But when a mistake happens over and over and when a promise is broken nearly every time there comes a point when your experience needs to be shared and the issue needs to be resolved. I also know that this is just a phone and that the world has way worse issues, but I am a working Father who doesn't have the extra time or money to buy a new phone after the device given to me was defective. I hope this is helpful to people and thanks for listening to my rant!",

Charging this phone is not as fast as some other phones like oneplus 3, honor 8 or the axon 7. but you have wireless charging which makes up for it. The headphones included in the box are great as well. The fingerprint scanner location is not an issue for me, I have a case on and it's not difficult to reach but it does take some getting used to. The camera is also one of the best right up there with the google pixel. The sound is pretty good, not amazing like stereo speaker phones but its loud and clear enough. it's easy to use with one hand even though it has a huge 5.8-inch screen thanks to the new 18.5 by 9 screen aspect ratio and the 84% screen to body ratio.",

They fixed the problem that I had with the Galaxy S7 Edge that I often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the \"edges\" of this screen anymore. I have a Google Pixel XL and I'm going to switch for the Samsung Galaxy s8, not the S8+, because even with my big hands I have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the S8+. The screen of the S8 is even bigger than the Google Pixel XL by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the Pixel XL. In terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the Google Pixel XL, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. You can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market. Pros: -Design -Wireless Charging -Latest processor -Bluetooth 5.0 -Mobile HDR Premium technology -No problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently. -water/dust resistance IP68 -Good battery optimization -USB Type-C -headphones 3.5mm input -AKG earbuds included -Great quality camera -Beautiful display (image) -USB Type-C to USB adapter included -USB Type-C to USB adapter included -Pay safely virtually at any store with Samsung Pay (something that Apple Pay and Android Pay can't do) -Comes already with Android 7.0 Nougat -Expandable storage via MicroSD Card. Cons: -Comes with 64GB of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the MicroSD card -No unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like Google Pixel and Pixel XL) -Fingerprint in one of the worst places possible. -Sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)",

The buttons for volume and for Bixby are almost directly opposite to the power button. This is the worst design ever. As a result, trying to turn off the screen is an extreme pain and usually results in a photo of my hand or activating Bixby or changing the volume. My old iPhone had a good design, with the power button on top. I'd have moved back to Apple, but can't stand the restrictions, like on managing music. The phone is a bit faster than the S7, but I have trouble with it responding to my touch. That could be a symptom of the screen protector causing interference though. I am not a fan of the curved edges, preferring the flat screen. The display quality is great. The fingerprint scanner is inconvenient, but I knew that was the case going into this phone.",

And I mean they REALLY can't hear a thing and get annoyed with me since I refuse to put the phone to my ear for safety reasons. Super annoying when watching to youtube because the EDGE feature is too sensitive and all phone covers are designed to NOT cover up the edges. The youtube program changes if you fingers get within 1/16th of an inch of the edge of the screen. How do you hold the phone and not get anywhere near the edge? You don't actually have to touch the screen to change youtube programs. Then there is no BACK button to get back to youtube I was just watching. Other phones have a BACK button. Screen is way too sensitive. Even setting phone face down on electrical wires will change youtube program. Putting phone in pocket while youtube is playing changes the youtube channel 100% of the time no matter how careful I am to not touch the screen. I do not watch youtube in full screen... usually searching for next video while one is playing. Another super totally annoying feature is screenshots. You have to hold down the volume down button and the power button at the same time..90% of the time the volume just changes and no screenshot.... or screenshot with volume bar showing.

A lot of people complain about the location of the fingerprint scanner, which does take some getting used to. But keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner. Hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device. See what I mean? I found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone. Unfortunately, there was something I couldn't get past with this particular model. The edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight. I almost switched back to my iPhone 7 plus, but after using the S8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky! If you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus. If you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you! Also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker. When you're outside, the color stands out a lot more. Update: after spending 3-4 days with the s8 plus, I ended up switching back to the s8.

One week after my phone arrived, it slipped from my lab, falling two feet to the stone floor, shattering my screen. Never in the past eight years have I ever cracked a screen, and I cracked the s8 within a week. Don't believe me? Look up stress tests for the s8, and you'll see it performs worse compared to previous phones. Pros: 1. Nice camera 2. Great battery life 3. TONS of storage space Cons: 1. Breaks far too easily 2. Fingerprint scanner not located in a convenient location, and it usually takes ~10 tries to get the phone to even recognize my fingerprint. 3. The virtual home buttons disappear in some apps, making it annoying to try to close the app quickly. 4. There is an extra button added to this phone below the volume buttons for something called \"Bixby\" which advertises itself as being some sort of virtual planner, providing the option to do an amazon search for something using image recognition. It's a cool concept, but I'm always pressing the button when I don't want to see it, and the image search feature is just a commercialized use of computer vision.",

I was then locked out of my phone and my nightmare began. I opened a trouble ticket with Samsung support and followed their instructions for verifying ownership of the phone. They failed to follow-up with me and when I called back to check the ticket status, I was told the ticket was created incorrectly so they had to close and re-open a new ticket. They asked me to wait another 24 to 48 hours for resolution. The time elapsed and again they failed to follow-up with me. I called back and was told they needed another 24 hours. Once again no follow-up. I called back and was told the ticket was closed because the receipt I had emailed them did not contain enough information for verification of ownership. I now have a third ticket opened, have sent them 3 emails containing information they requested and still cannot use my phone. I can only say I have enjoyed the Samsung products I have purchased until this recent experience, but in the future I will consider the quality of support when buying my electronics.",

The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography. It blows away apple in my opinion, Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc's. It also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple. Any android can be plugged into any PC without a problem with no software to clog up your PC. The processor is killer,4 gig of ram! And I was sold on the camera immediately. Being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.The battery is OK but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick. But this can be controlled, Power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabs on the battery. It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in. I can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price? the s8 and s9 at least for a while. I give the s8 5 stars!!!",

Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power. I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased. Below is my list of pro and con. Pro: Decent Camera, good with low light environment. Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past. Support wireless charging, water-proof. Less overheating. It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold. Con: Unusual Screen ratio. Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market. This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing. Overall, I think this is a good phone.

                "review_text": "For clarification I have the U.S model of this phone with the snapdragon processor. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because frankly I could talk about this phone all day. I've had this phone for a few months now and am now ready to review it, I'll break down this review into build quality, screen quality, weight, audio quality/call quality, processor speed, camera quality, battery life and ease of navigating the software. - Build quality is outstanding, the phone looks and feels as good as it gets.The phone is a little slippery though so I do recommend a case for it, more on that later. -Screen quality- This is by far the best display I have ever seen on a phone, samsungs amoled display technology is at the top of its game. Colors pop,contrast is incredible and the blacks are truly black and because of the curved screen the content you view on it whether its photos or videos has an almost 3d effect to it. Samsung also offers display adjustments in phone options if you want more neutral colors instead of the saturated colors amoled is known for, either way this display is top notch! Weight- Suprisingly light weight for how sturdy it feels. The S8 feels good in pocket and won't have you wishing you had a lighter phone anytime soon. Audio quality/ Call quality - Audio with this phone is above average but not the best, music, movies, games all sound good whether you're using head phones or the phone speaker, the phone speaker does distort at high volumes though, but you'll most likely be using headphones anyway. The included earbuds that come with the phone were very good (at least before they shorted out) so heads up on that, also I'd recommend a eq app like power amp if you want to fine tune your sound. Call quality on the other had is hands down phenomenal, I've made a lot of calls with this phone and have constantly been blown away with how crisp and clear the calls are. Processor Speed- Calling this phone fast is an understatement, I've tried my best at times to get this phone to slow down and just can't do it. Everything is snappy and instantaneous whether youre opening an app or loading a web page. This phone doesn't break a sweat! Camera quality - The camera on this phone is fantastic, the photos are amazing, with one downside low light photos fo have more noise than I'd like in them. I'll attach some example's to this review so you can see for yourself. This phone won't replace a high end dedicated camera, but you could do a lot worse. Battery Life - I have to give credit to both Samsung and android for this one. The battery life on this phone is outstanding, i can get two and a half days out of this phone easy. I'm pretty easy going on my phone though, I wouldn't call myself a power user by any means, but I didn't put this phone through its paces a couple times and and came out impressed, even with heavy usage and screen brightness turned all the way up this phone made it through a day and a half of nothing but videos, web surfing, and music playing with battery to spare. If you need even more run time, you can put the phone into varying degrees of battery saving modes that can squeeze out even more run time ( the emergency mode can give you months of battery time, granted you can't do much else besides make calls but it could be a life saver). Ease of navigating software - Short answer is its cake. The long answer is its intuitive and ridiculously easy to move around in menus and find what you are looking for. Samsung has really out done themselves here and it shows. Honestly I can't think of a single negative about the software, it's done so well. Now, for the drawback I mentioned earlier in the review. Finding a case with a screen protector for this phone that actually works, and doesn't impede the use of the screen is kinda impossible because of the curved screen, even otter box doesn't have on that works. You can always buy one of the wallet type cases to cover the screen, it'll help avoiding damage. Of course if a screen protector isnt a big deal for you then you're golden. The phone does have the latest and greatest gorilla glass 5 on it so scratches really aren't an issue I've noticed zero on my phone. The wallet case I have on my phone has held up well and protected my phone from a couple of drops I'll be reviewing that shortly. I don't count this against the phone because this isn't really big deal to me but it might be to you, at the end of the day this phone is incredible and if your in the market for a phone the S8 should be at the top of your list.",

Back to this S8 here. I'm gonna just mention the basics, coz I see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, I'll try to answer from experience! - The edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out. I really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp! Any picture, movie, YouTube video looks just better on this screen. - The camera is just great! While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, I still think this S8 is a little better. - Games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat. - The size is just perfect, and the weight too! It feels as big as my Google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! ) iWas gonna get the S8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the S8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too. -The battery is nothing special, I can say I'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day. Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days I didn't need to. You'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now. I absolutely it love it and I think you will too!",

A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8 screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay, I don't know what shops charge. You can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone",

In the past week or so I have fallen in love with this phone the extra little features are awesome. the finger print scanner on the back of the phone was a bit weird to me at first but now that i have gotten a bit more used to it I think it is a nice change. making it easier to unlock your phone as you take it out of your pocket. all in all the device deserves a 4/5. i will explain the reason i think it should get a 4/5 and there is only one issue. If i could give the the device a 4.5 I would but that is not how amazon works. I have one single complaint. the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used. at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again. just recently Samsung REMOVED the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant Bixby. since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is Bixby. doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device. It is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen.",

Bought S8 and I had to say it is the worst Galaxy I've owned. The main issue is screen that cracks SO easily. I didn't even drop the phone, I sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack. In a few more days I got a few more cracks. There is absolutely no value in the \"infinity\" screen, it's beautiful but worthless. In my 8 years of owning multiple Galaxies I only cracked the screen once, and I dropped it many times. S8 has a design flaw. Then there's Samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you. Bixby is useless but you can't disable it. It wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps... What a piece of garbage! Samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than Google's but they enable it by default. At least Samsung has accepted my return and out of loyalty I bought S7 which I am much happier with.",

The screen on my OP2 cracked, so I decided to splurge and got myself this beauty. In retrospect, I should have just repaired my OP2's screen. The S8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment. It gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion. The curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car. A lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location. It's not ideal, but I've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me. Android purists will not be happy with the fact that Samsung tries to force their \"Google Now\" clone called \"Bixby\" onto the user. It is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as \"Google Now\" does. They have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else. a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - Otherwise, I would have gotten an Iphone, had I wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things. Some very common widgets (Such as Google Keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio. The all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another. Ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty. The display and camera are nice, but that's not something lacking in most modern phones.

I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it. My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out. The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same. After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly. I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it. The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia. I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone. There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc. I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc. This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month.",

Unfortunately it happened to me just as it apparently has happened to many other users (if you google galaxy s8 cracked screen, you will find many results) So even though all the rest of the phone is outstanding, I would never ever buy it again as it will not even last even a month. My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 USD and that I know I would have to repair it again just a few weeks later. Of course, I have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily. I have been a faithful Samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately I will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of LG, Sony or HTC now. PS: The stunning Edge-Glass-Infinity-Screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem. I guess one has to decide between the most beautiful and most breakable phone, or an a little bit less beautiful but more robust phone.",

Shame on Samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the Bixby button to something else.. The Battery is O.K. but not great and for the money I think the phone should have 6Gs of RAM. Screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that Samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the Note 7. All in all I really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you. **6/2/17 ** I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U.S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!! They originally said it would be up and working in the spring and now they are delaying it again. This makes this phone a great BETA device but definitely not ready for Prime time!! It's like a great looking sports car that can t go past 70 miles per hour!! really!!! and they dedicated a button to something that they can't get to work!!

                "review_header": "A Big Advancement Over Samsung's Previous Phones", 
                "review_text": "Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers. A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production. I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile). Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6. This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate: displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com) How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird. This is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of. Even LG's unique G6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). I really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8). The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM) . My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years. In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....",

Because the darn thing is needlessly ENTIRELY GLASS, and virtually NO edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone. Cracks in the middle (mine was ONLY on the right \"infinity\" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so I could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed. The insurance company REFUSES to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 DAYS! I demanded Sprint make it right, but, as nice as Sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of D's. RUDE! They even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud. WTF!? So I left Sprint for T-Mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE. Second phone (first with TMobile) survived about a week and a half. It was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground IN A PROTECTIVE CASE! Looking at it right now. I knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so I've decided to just get a Samsung J7; basically a Note 4 without the stylus. Since I'm looking at my Note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, I'm glad to have a cheaper phone I don't mind so much breaking, and will eventually file a claim with TMobile, once I can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again. I love Samsung, but I HATE this phone! It's only brought me misery, and $1400 dollars down the toilet. Also, side note, no current phone repair places can fix this, because of the \"inifinity\" screen junk,",
