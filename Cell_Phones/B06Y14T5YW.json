                "review_text": "BEWARE! 99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION! After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!) Pro's: 1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone. 2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8) 3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it. 4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it. 5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple. 6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here. 7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone. 8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour. 9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+. 10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds. 11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone. 12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers. 13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets. Neutral: 1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions. 2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect. 3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it. 4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it. 5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs. 6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read. Con's: 1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness. 2. \"Ok Google\". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change. 3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood). 4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button. On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know. As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot! Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways. Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.",

                "review_text": "I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network. My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website. It takes just 5-10 minutes. Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6. Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy. Other than that the actual phone is great. Very sleek looking phone. This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower. If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.",

Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one. Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.",

                "review_text": "I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus. I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish. This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20. I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3T were so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8. I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me. The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands. I don't think I will go back to a 6\" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too. Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled. I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc. Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock. They should move the camera to the corner like some phones. USB-C is awesome. Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though). I have a few gripes. Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos. My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers. Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist. By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it. This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.",

                "review_text": "The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+. It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates. I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5. In the end it was worth the upgrade. As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5. I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning. Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon. This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store. This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a \"Verizon Branded\" S8. Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out. After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything. Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all. Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app. You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store. Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me. Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.",

                "review_text": "I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .) This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy: -Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though) -Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though) -Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself. -Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...) -You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!) -Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.) -It still allows your to insert microphone jacks. -USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.) -And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival. Some downsides on the phone: -Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone) -Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone. -Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled. -Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though. This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional. All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all. (Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)",

Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays. The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range. Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs. The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps. The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens. I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!",

There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures. The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).",

I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy. I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me \"Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back\". So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business? I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.",

And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card. The processor and ram have nice performance on apps. Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera. Personally, I haven't had a problem with that. Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary. The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me. I'm just not using that function. The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software. It's not bad. But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do ________? or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?' For some people, that may be Bixby. Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well. But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it. Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version. It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that. But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops. And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools. Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time. But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons. When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game. It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it. It's not a lot in the scheme of things.

Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack. With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda. Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it. Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth headsets allow the companies to track you differently. Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing. I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.

It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video.

Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly. My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case. My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.",

It may or may not have been \"unlocked by Samsung\", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone. Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types. When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying \"not a Verizon sim card\" error message in the notification tray. You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone. I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung. It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it. For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising. 1/11/2018 - Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today. It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined. Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from \"Electronic Deals\" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store.",

However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper. So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward. I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone. I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box. All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!",

(Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.) If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone. The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already. One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone. You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps. Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.

Cons: -Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case) -Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case) -Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.

                "review_text": "I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price. Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8\" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure. The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's \"Infinity Display\". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour) Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month. Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant. Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone. Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear. Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work. Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps. Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other. NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.",

Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.

The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement). The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button. I'm glad that Samsung has added a \"disable\" feature, but remapping that button would be great. Beyond that, love the phone :)",

Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there!

You can clearly see spots on the back and front glass where the inside laminate has been scraped off due to device being opened (for repair). Then there's smudge/lint/dust on the INSIDE of the rear and front camera lenses (shoddy repair job). Then most of all, there's a clicking/clacking right below the 3d touch home button area of the front screen, which again hints at a pretty shoddy repair job on whoever it was beforehand AND pretty much means the IP68 water/dust resistance is out the door. The clicking/clacking is most likely from no/bad adhesive on that screen area by whoever repaired/rebuilt the device. I wouldn't have minded a used device with some signs of use and scratches here and there, BUT the bad repair job means that A) it wasn't repaired by a certified repair place...SO VOIDED MFG WARRANTY B) the clicking/clacking area is a weakspot for the screen made worst because that's where the 3d touch home button is ALONG with it being a ingress point for condensation/water/dust Apart from all that, the battery discharge rate is pretty high even at idle. I don't feel like dealing with all these issues down the line for a phone that I want to last me at least another 2 years. I don't mind the used cosmetic state (since I use a case) of the device, BUT the BAD REPAIR JOB, along with that the device probably doesn't have any MFG warranty anymore (voided from the bad repair job), and the nonexistence of any IP68 water/dust resistance (due to bad repair job again) just wants me to stay away from this device and potential problems it could give me (if it can last 2 years). In conclusion, if I wanted a repaired/rebuilt device, I would've gone in that category instead, BUT used with cosmetic damage in my dictionary doesn't mean repaired/rebuilt. It's like thinking you're buying a used car just by going off of what the seller is advertising as a clean used car, but you're actually getting a rebuilt totaled car (which in itself could be a good thing discount wise, BUT there are definitely underlying problems)",

The battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the \"always on\" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. I haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. I'm sad to see the S Pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the Note 8, but I'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. The camera is also pretty reasonable. Low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. The camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside. The S8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. It's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately. The software is also quite nice. There's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. Samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. Overall no complaints. My carrier is Verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. I just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a SIM card for free. I was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and I called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the Verizon employee took care of the rest. I recommend using Google or Verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like Samsung Kies) to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone. I forgot to do that so I walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until I worked it out on my own. Set up backups NOW, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason I was able to get my contacts off of it was because the S Pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so I could blindly punch in my PIN to unlock the phone.",

Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously.

It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex. Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box. So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read \" not a verizon sim card\" anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. I got home and checked my main features I use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the Verizon network.",

I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with \"Hi, Bixby\". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is \"Ok, Google\". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.",

You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, \"KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)\" & \"BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)\" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk. Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device. If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you.",

I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like \"her\" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him. Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge \"tray\" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes.",

One CAUTION about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. For instance, I have AT&T, and I don't have Visual Voicemail on this phone. You should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. But other than the minor nuisance, I love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever Network I may want to use. In terms of the phone itself, I personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all.

Facial recognition on this phone is a joke. I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat. The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO.

It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes. Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).

Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable. So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc..

Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is: -The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment. Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone. Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera. Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around. So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner. If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere. I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time). Returning this POS.",

Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this? If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!",

                "review_text": "First off, from a hardware viewpoint this is an amazing handset. Stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen. Then ... Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes. I just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake! And the Bixby key? So many people don't want your Bixby key, plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. So Samsung adds the option to disable the Bixby key ... ONLY if you jump through all the hoops, creating a Samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. Nonsense. Just another data mining exercise. Then there is the Oreo update. I pay a premium for an Unlocked, from Samsung, handset ... then Verizon and T-mobile handsets get the update first. Really Samsung?? You're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major OS updates? A 200.00 Xaomi MI is a recognized Android One phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 Samsung is months late? Seriously? If that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 USD plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock Android experience. No Bixby, no 300 Samsung apps that I'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what YOU want me to do in an effort to mine my software. This will honestly be my last Samsung phone ... if I wanted a locked down experience I'd buy an iPhone. There is a very good reason why companies like Oneplus, Xaomi and Essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. A quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable. At this point, I plan to see what the Oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the Bixby button and the option to use Google Assistant like it was designed, I'll sell this junk and buy a Oneplus 6. At least then I won't be controlled by a company, being told what I can and cannot do on a device that I bought and paid for. Frankly, there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. I bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it.",

                "review_text": "I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed. The positives: 1. The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging. 2. The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers. 3. The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege. 4. The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones. The negatives: 1. No hard button on the front. I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button. I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you. It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place. That tactile feedback is missing on this phone. Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN. That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen. That's just stupid. 2. No user replaceable battery. This is simply inexcusable. I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary. There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user. It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover. Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery. I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery. 3. Oddly sized: This phone is too tall and too narrow. As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well. 4. Oddly shaped: The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets. Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image. In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges. It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped. 5. Bixby Button: Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri. There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button. Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button. But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account. Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button. Again, this is stupid. If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it. Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so. In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead.",

                "review_text": "To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the \"best phone out there\". Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is \"the best phone out there\". Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on. So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that \"During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung\u2019s sole option, without charge.\" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products. So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty. Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.",

The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious. One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it. If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it.",

For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen.

I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed. Cons 1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed) 2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried. 3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen) 4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement. 5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future. Pros - (most other flagships are equal here) 1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining. 2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps. 3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices. 4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too. In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display. I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months. Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if, 1. I can get a flat display again 2. Take the buttons off the screen. 3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front.",

The screen has Gorilla Glass 5 and it's not easy to ruin with scratches. Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges, cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible. That was only problem I suppose that i've had so far. Otherwise, the phone is amazing and you won't be disappointed.",

I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely. Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method).

No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen. I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER.",

Google it there are plenty of forums that say there are no fixes for these problems.
