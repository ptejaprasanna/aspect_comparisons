Touch ID on the iPhone 8 is faster and easier to use than Face ID - and enables me to open my phone before it leaves my pocket. I was also worried about the impact of Face ID which beams infrared laser dots into my eyes 30 times a day (10,000 times a year). I prefer the rectangular screen of the 8 to the one on the X with its curved corners and weird inset. Best of all, I can orientate my iPhone 8 simply by feeling the touch ID button - even in the dark or in a pocket. I can also see exactly how much battery percentage I have left, and closing apps is a snap compared to the X. The iPhone 8 is brilliant - it's fast, simple and familiar to use. By comparison, the iPhone X feels gimmicky because its so-called innovations make it harder to use.",
