                "review_text": "I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus. UPDATE: 4/7/2018. The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer. 2nd UPDATE: I didn't realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options. 3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018 I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely. 4th UPDATE April 23, 2018 As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.",

The phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from Samsung.com. I also chose the bundle which included a 128 GB mini SD card as well as a Fast Wireless Charger stand. The bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. Great deal if you ask me. I am coming from a Samsung Note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the Note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the S9+ . The phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun. Once the Note 9 comes out, I will be sure to compare that against the S9+ but in the mean time, I will switch between this S9+ and my Note 8 as my daily driver. (Its something about the S pen on my Note 8 that I can not let go. Great phone. I would reccomend this device.",

It's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone. If your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment.

                "review_text": "I've had many Samsung phones and liked them. But my most recent phone was an LG V20, which I was also very happy with. The camera glass cracked after 2 years, and I decided to get another Samsung. Overall this is a great phone. I wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons. I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you. One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware. I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it. It continues to nag me to use one of the apps. I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat. I already bought the phone. If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them. But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users. I guess to avoid this you have to buy a Google phone.",

The phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well. While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect. In terms of it being a tool, I haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the S7 couldn't do. It comes with something called \"Bixby\" that I guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess I'm not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it... I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar. If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket. In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.",

It walked me through how to attach the included cable and attachment to my j3v. Transferred and Bam! It works. Went out to my carriers website and already show up. No problems. The only thing you can not do with your carrier (you should check with yours) is that you can not get insurance on a phone unless purchased through your carrier.

I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device. Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps. But this is not, in any way, a downside.

                "review_text": "After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day. THE GOOD: Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life. Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :) The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department. THE \"DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING\": Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity? Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place! Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone. Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense! As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it. THE BAD: The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess. Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem. Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",

I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago. I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though: Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet. If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it. (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before. Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected. The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in. The price for the phone was about average. I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies. Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES. if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user. I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing. I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook. I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.",

I've been using Google phones for a number of years so I was concerned about Samsung wrecking the UI. But after disabling Bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I'm concerned. I like the \"infinity screen\" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone. My 5X is only a bit smaller than the S9+! My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery! The 5X has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, I greatly miss that. For example when I navigate while driving I put the phone on my right knee. This new phone immediately slides right off. I'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it.

Dimensions - it's extremely similar to the S8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.Visually, the screen is fantastic. The touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy. The fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the S8.

The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market. The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues. The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either. I use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time. Coming from an iphone user this is much better!",

I need it for shooting video and 656 GB of available memory I have finally no problem. Camera is to die for, love colors and depth, comparable to iPhone X, so iPhone lost its prevous advantage. Display is the best currently available on any smartphone. Samsung definitely leads the game here. Sounds is stereo with Dolby, what makes it way more pleasant than iPhoneX currently. In terms of speed, it is maybe because of software, I do not play games, but for everything else I feel that Galaxy S9+ is faster than iPhone. 6 GB RAM makes lot of sense, as well. It really feels like fast computer and going back to anything slower is painful. Fast charging and wireless fast charging are added bonuses, it takes few short hours and works perfect. At current price for global market models (2 SIM cards, faster processor, 256 GB memory) and I paid 930 $, it is way better proposition than iPhone X. It is much cheaper to pay 100% for the phone and pick some smarter plan than to buy on monthly plan. Do the math. Bottom line, as convert from Apple, I may witness that Galaxy is truly an achievement, design, quality, functionality and reliability. It is all there now.",

I can honestly say that if the phone I own now, is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now (in regards to not developing glitches/issues), that it will be the best phone I have ever owned. I have never and will never own an Iphone, and I have never been a samsung anything guy in the past either. I have never liked samsung electronics (always found them 'cheaper' than competitor products). My first samsung phone 20 years ago (flip phone) was complete rubbish. My Son's Galaxy 5 (or 6?) was a nightmare. THIS PHONE however, has won me over. - Reception - best. - App speed - best. - Battery - very good. - Glitchiness - none. - Voice quality - very good. - Visuals - outstanding. The ONLY thing NOT superior on this phone vs my last is sound. I have had HTC flagship phones in the past couple of years and they are way ahead of their time with speaker/voice/sound quality. The bar was set very high with the HTC and I never expected the Galaxy to match it, nevermind beat it, BUT the Galaxy makes a valiant effort. I will miss that sound with my old phone, but if that is the only thing I have to sacrifice for an otherwise far superior phone, I can live with that. Only other concern I have is that the responsiveness to the screen, with or without a screen protector sometimes has me thinking it is not capturing my finger taps and swipes, but it is very minor (for now). I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that . I will post back after some time of using this phone to inform if it is still holding up to this gleaming review. I am on T-mobile with this phone as a point of reference. Lastly, I really wanted to buy an unbranded phone here from Amazon, but I had to buy from T-mobile because I have read that you cannot utilize the wifi calling feature with unbranded phones. While this is not a HUGE deal for me, it is a feature that while I don't use often, it would be a nice feature to have if I need it. That said, my biggest reason for wanting to buy an unbranded phone is to avoid bloatware, but honestly, this phone isn't too bad in that respect. Not that i have noticed thus far anyway.",

In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products. I am so thrilled I took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why: 1. Super high quality phone - with simple set up. 2. AMAZING camera with loads of different features. 3. Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device. 4. DUAL WHATSAPP!!! 5. Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible). Same was not true ot iPhone products. 6. I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future. 7. Can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!! It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now!!",

I also love everything software wise besides Bixby I always hit it by accident coming from the Lg G6 I am used to volume down being there. But here's my issue with it the screen curve away from the viewer annoys the crap out of me if i prop my phone up with its stand to watch videos the curved part usually gets a glare and it makes the phone far less easy to protect with the screen being way more open to contact on dropping it. I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing (No Bixby) but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.",

Lastly, the power save on the phone is still bad, If someone is new to Samsung will not know he or she needs to turn off the battery saving mode on some apps such as Gmail and Yahoo mail, or their E-mails will be arrived late.",

                "review_text": "Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both. PROs: - The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting. - Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh - Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns. - Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds. - AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone - Thin phone - 4k Video quality - Great Speakers - Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader). - Live Translations with Bixby Vision - (Plus Version) Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable - (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capture CONs: - While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated. - There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones. - What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking \"I should give Bixby a try\" - While thin, it's somewhat heavy. - Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus. VERDICT: As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.",

Not my ideal phone but it is good. Right out the box I had to make some adjustments. Deleted a slew of aps or moved them to a folder. Changed the always on display to not, because battery life is a thing I need. Phone case, yeah I got a clear one and a skin, because the downside to a phone like this is everyone has one and I don't want to advertise I have an s9+ for theft reasons. So I got it in purple because black is bi gender and purple is for girls and gays so there is less value in the black market if stolen. Got me a skin and a clear case and a film screen protector, because I don't plan on upgrading till 2020 when you know 98% screen phones will be a thing (like bro I don't need the NSA always looking at me with a front facing camera). So yeah. I mean the camera is awesome. It is literally why you get an s9+. You get an iPhone x if you are an idiot who is allergic to money and wants to blow $5000 on the app store and when your iPhone breaks you don't believe in repairing so you buy a new one, like that is cool dawg. So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah. I wish this thing had an IR blaster because jacking control over devices is useful. Like my ac etc. But I have an honor 8 to use as an ac remote when I can't find it... So that is good. I shouldn't eat at restaurant that play CNN fake news anyway, so annoying, one lady kept turning back on the TV when I kept turning it off. Like wtf yo. So I guess I can live without an IR blaster. I am surprised this thing has a headphone jack and is ip 68 rated for water. Kudos. iPhone x is ip 67, losers.",

I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time. Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include \"Bixby,\" microphone placement, and voice recognition. First, the \"Bixby\" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled. Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down. Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone \"hears\" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible. Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.",

The slide down feature on the lock screen has many options, but no clock or calculator like the iPhone does (without add-on modifying). The standard ring tones are very limited and not desirable. Even though the music plays loud, the ringtones do not. Even though it has a press button lock, then swipe, it still seems to unlock in my pocket. But the iPhone did too. The Bixby turns on when I DONT want it to, and doesn't when I do. Very frustrating. The USB C connector is nice. There are 1000 things this phone can do that I have not discovered yet.",

The worst part is that Samsung refuses to cover the screen under their \"warranty.\" The local shop they sent us to did fix the 9 for about $100 less than the S8 (total was $235 for the S9 fix). Also, remember this phone just came out, we've had it less than two months. The shop said they already had 20+ people in with broken S9 screens.

It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it. Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on.

                "review_text": "I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications. I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me. Decided to try S9 due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always there, making that 5\" screen more like 4.5\", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense.. Anyway, S9 notifications: No notifications on locked screen: I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen. Limited notifications on locked screen: Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app. Raise to wakeup and show notifications: With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure... Notifications while using the phone: Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup. All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ? App Icon number: Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few. Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different. Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got. Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung... All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications. Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ? Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and rarely nail a single one. First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what. Second crazy option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ? Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification. I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen; Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore. In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9. Duh.. And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge. All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9. Some notable positive sides: Samsung Internet browser is just awesome. LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-, to \"help\" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one. Starting camera with double click to Power button. Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone. Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder. Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7. --------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification: Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. Some people actually LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls. 2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them. 3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed. 3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings - \"Wake Up screen on Notifications\". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option. 4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me. I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",

Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning. My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8. I'm having so many issues with it. I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone! What are the odds? When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen. Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text. Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode. We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review. Aren't I the lucky one? I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone. New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone. Wish me luck please! Thanks.",
