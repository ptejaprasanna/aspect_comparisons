                "review_text": "I believe this model is for Europe so it comes with 220 voltage cable charger. At least mine did. Therefore, you need 110v charging cable or wireless charger if you are considering this in US. But given this age, I'm sure people have lots of 110v chargers lying around. I simply put my AT&T SIM card from other phone and it works just fine It is Dual SIM slot so you can play it with either two SIM cards or one SIM and a SD card. Battery life is decent. I talk to other people quite a bit, occasional youtube and surfing internet on daily basis and battery lasts good for me. I had S7 edge with 3,600 mAh before and surprisingly, I feel both have similar battery life, so no complaining for me. I assume that software optimization works well as Samsung presents. But if battery life is still your main concern, then simply put battery saving mode, and you will be fine since there isn't much of performance loss from it. S pen is certainly a nice thing to play with. I can draw, write things on the phone. Personally, it helps me a lot for my new work environment. I don't use Bixby much but voice commands seem to work accurately. I don't have a big hand, but location of its button doesn't bother me that much. I don't use finger print unlock thingy at all so no comments on that. Iris scan feature works well too, if you are interested. But I use pattern unlock most of time. This supposedly great dual camera works fine. Quality of pictures are certainly nice and sharp. But because photography is my acutal/serious hobby, I use DSLR a lot. So this dual camera isn't that attractive to me. Don't get me wrong though, it will serve you great for sure. I bought this phone for S pen, not camera. As many of you know it by now, screen display of this phone is phenomenal. It's beautiful and sucks you right in. I don't know much about sound quality because I use bluetooth earbuds and android auto most of the time. Speaker of the phone itself sounds decent enough but for sure there are better phones for this matter. But it's not game changer for me. I can't compare its overall with equivalent products from Apple or any other brand for that matter, because I've used Samsung phones only since beginning of the time. (being Korean does that easily for you) To sum up, for people with experiences of Samsung products, If you want the cool, latest, flagship phone of the time even if S pen is for decoration only and wallet is thick enough, then it's for you. If you want cool, latest, flagship of the time and okay with spending quite sum but not this much and S pen isn't interesting, then S8/S8+ is for you. If you use/will use S pen extensively, and/or seeking upgrade from Note 4, 5 and 7(FE), then it's for you. (Don't forget trade-in deals) If you know that you want this specific phone for sure but don't want pay this much whatsoever and have a patience, then wait til next spring/summer when S9 comes out. (Not an official, but for sure there will be one) If you are okay with wife yelling at you for paying this much on a single phone, then it's for you (totally not personal experience, just saying) These are my personal opinion, yours will be vary.",

                "review_text": "I had the Note 3 for exactly 4 years. I also bought but never much used the Nokia Lumia 1020 (better camera but lousy OS). I loved my Note 3 and used it all the time for camera, web searches, MANY audio books, some note-taking and so on. Even used it for a phone! Now that I have the Note 8, the old Note 3 seems suddenly so old and slow and clunky. I studied reviews of ALL the \"flagship\" phones including the iPhone X (overpriced). I kept thinking I PROBABLY really wanted the S-pen (MUCH improved since Note 3) but still spent many, many hours looking at other options. Finally I decided I did want the pen feature and so Samsung's monopoly won the day. Nothing about the 8 disappoints. It is a fantastic phone and super smooth and fast and elegant and excellent, comparable to or surpassing similarly priced phones, in almost every way. The ONLY problem I have is the sealed in, non-removable battery. But nobody sells a removable battery anymore. Sigh. By the way I use the S-pen (like right now) all the time. It's uses and functionlity are awesome. All-in-all, Samsung has gotten pretty much everything right, I'd say. The amount of design and tech in this thing is utterly awesome. No bloat, smooth ease of use, power! I guess I love this thing.",

The box came perfectly sealed with the following inside: * Samsung Note 8 (Dual Sim) (Condition: New) * European Charger with adapter * USB type C cable with 2 separate connectors (for transferring everything from your old galaxy to the note 8) * New AKG earbuds with extra buds in varying sizes * Sim tray unlock tool * Extra tips for your S pen with removal tool * Complimentary hard plastic case * Manual I used the cable and connectors to transfer all my files, music, photos, and texts to thr Note 8. You can also choose what you'd like to scrap before the transfer. I was set up in minutes! I've had it for a few days now, no issues. I like the fact that you can also choose if you'd want to use fast charging or regular charging. I had the same option on my Note 4. After fully charged this baby lasts hours. Currently, it is 7am as I post this review with 50% and my last charge was the afternoon prior at 2pm. Runs smoothly, no hiccups. Camera quality is amazing. Wi update my review in couple weeks.",

Here are the problems I am having: 1) will not do carrier aggregation therefore maximum download is around 17mbps and upload is around 6mbps while in the exact same location my Galaxy S8+ download is 82mbps and upload is 44mbps. 2) AT&T will not provision LTE advanced features such as Wi-Fi calling or advanced messaging. 3) AT&T will not recognize the IMEI in order to push secondary LTE bands and with that also throttles your bandwidth. I use my phone heavily for work and require high bandwidth speeds for presentations, collaboration and other internet hog programs and therefore this specific model phone will not work for me and thought I should let everyone know what I'm experiencing. You can kind of somewhat band-aid fix some of the above issues by rooting your phone and loading custom firmware and ROMs but if I did that I could no longer user it for my job and therefore the phone is useless to me... I love everything else about the phone including the gold color and am sad to have to send it back and go buy a dang AT&T branded one.",

The transition into this 18.5/9 ratio is quick after messing with settings, it made the phone even better from using gestures to get around and get the most out of the devics. This thing is fast and snappy, after changing a few settings and adding my fave launcher omg nothing can slow this down(for now). Theres only 2 things that im not entirely sold on. 1) on the back there is a DUOS branding(its not that bad but still takes away from the astetic. 2) this one is not entirely about the phone but more of the accessories it came with, since this is the international model it has a Europe charger but they did provide an adapter but it just makes the charger even more bulky.",

Brand new and sealed. To sum up, I am perfectly satisfied! The phone itself is a real beast! First of all, the build quality is excellent. It feels solid, premium and outstanding. It has a \"DUOS\" logo on the back, which, in my opinion, looks good. The large display is really awesome! Great colors, great quality, it is indeed the best display on the market right now. What is more, it is not uncomfortable at all, despite its size, I can quickly get used to it. The Note 8 is ultra fast and I highly doubt that anything can slow it down. This, in addition to the big screen, makes it perfect for multitasking. I was a bit concerned about the battery life, but after using the phone for a few days I can confirm that the battery is great as well. It can easily last me a whole day and I use the phone a lot. The fingerprint sensor is not as hard to reach as people report it to be, but I still find the facial recognition better. It is super fast, even in low light, and I love it. The camera is also amazing. It has tons of options you can play with, and moreover, the pro mode lets you set the settings manually, just like you can with a DSLR, which contributes to having even better pictures. I love the \"live focus\", it creates some great bokeh photos. Although the Note 8 doesn't have dual speakers, the audio is great too. It is really loud and satisfies my needs. The phone is packed with lots of features and I love every single one of them! Some examples are the edge screen, the off screen notes, the always on display, etc. The S Pen really comes handy all the time. Having it is definitely worth it and it makes the Note series stand out. I can't say much about Bixby since I haven't used it much yet. The package comes with a charger for the UK only. The phone says it originates from the UAE and what is more, its calendar has build in muslim holidays you cannot remove. But oh well, I quickly changed my calendar app and solved that problem. All in all, I am perfectly satisfied with everything! 5/5 stars for the seller and 5/5 for the Note 8!",

The battery life has been great. I easily get through a 24 hour period with no more than 75% of the battery life used up. On light days I can get 48 hours of use before hitting the 25% left notice. Don't listen to those people saying they only get 4 hours. The only people getting that kind of result are doing a lot of streaming and game playing and there is no phone out there that will go more than 4 or 5 hours doing that. The Spen has become a good business tool for me and I'm now doing business on the phone I used to reserve for my desktop.

I purchased this sold and shipped by Amazon (not third party) and received a brand new model SM-N950F phone. Given how delicate the phone is, warranty is important to me. While I was informed it would be covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty even with it being an international model because I purchased it from an authorized USA dealer (sold and shipped by Amazon), I ended up returning it. Why? While Samsung support will say the phone will be covered under warranty, in practice you won't be able to get it service as the Samsung repair centers won't touch international model phones. Call the actual Samsung phone service centers and ask. It sort of makes sense since they won't have all the same parts the international models have. If you can live with the risk of no warranty and it not being serviceable in the USA by Samsung repair centers, it's a fine phone.",

Today I want to share why I choose the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. There are far too many unique features to talk about. Although it looks great, there are more factors that played a role in making the decision to own it. SOFTWARE Freshly re-branded Samsung Experience is a mature Android and its qualities set it apart from other Android phones. Samsung Experience is very customizable. From the home screen you can swipe up or down to open your app cabinet. The screen supports over 4000 pressure sensitivity points, meaning tiny adjustments in pressure will change how your scribbles appear. CAMERA The main camera is excellent, producing clear, detailed and colorful shots that are worthy. There loads of modes to choose from, and there\u2019s even a Pro mode for adjusting settings such as shutter speed to your exact liking. While retaining the overall same look and approximate same size as the Galaxy S8+, it features and upgraded processor, and, For the first time in Samsung\u2019s smartphone history, a dual-camera system in the rear of the device; one functions as a wide-angle lens and the other as the telephoto lens, with both featuring 12MP resolution and optical stabilization. PROCESSING POWER The Note 8 is powered by a Exynos 8895 or Snapdragon 835 processor, depending on geographic region, along with 6GB of RAM. In the US it is sold with 64GB of internal storage along with a microSD card support, which is another favorite feature. The handset features a fingerprint scanner next to the rear camera, and retains facial recognition and iris recognition, which is similar to the S8. S PEN The S Pen offers expanded software features for the creation of handwritten notes. I love and use this feature a lot. I can remove the S Pen and immediately start writing notes on the display, which works due to the screen\u2019s always-on capabilities. \u201cTranslate\u201d is another great feature I love. It recognizes punctuations, lets me highlight entire sentences, and supports 71 different languages. The only thing I had to justify was a price. Thanks to those \u201cdeals\u201d I did not have to dish out whole $950 at once. It was broken down to small monthly payment with no interest and I became an owner of Note 8. In conclusion, I love my phone, although I\u2019m still learning every day something new about it. The looks, the works, the camera and all the features it comes with.",
